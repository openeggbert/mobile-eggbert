## 1. Project summary

**CNA** is a C++23 reimplementation of the XNA 4.0 programming model
(`Microsoft::Xna::Framework`), built on SDL3 with a pluggable graphics backend. It is a
framework/runtime, not a game.

- **This branch's goal:** port and verify `Microsoft::Xna::Framework::Audio` file-by-file against
  the authoritative FNA source (`/rv/data/library/github.com/FNA-XNA/FNA/src/Audio`), matching XNA
  behavior exactly, with full test coverage.
- **Current phase:** Phase 0–6 (original compliance/bugfix plan), Phase 7 (30 findings), and
  Phase 8 (25 findings) are fully closed. **Phase 9** (a fixed, user-specified 11-group hardening
  task list) is fully closed, plus 4 further user-directed follow-ups. **Phase 10**
  (`plan_audio.md`'s "Phase 10 — Audio correctness hardening and XNA/XACT parity") is now **fully
  closed: all 89/89 task IDs across all 12 groups are checked `[x]`**, as of the autonomous
  unattended continuation started 2026-07-06 that closed the final 6 (`P10-RPC-004/007`,
  `P10-FILTER-002/003/004/006`, `P10-LOOP-003/004`, `P10-AUDIT-002/003`, `P10-PAN-002`).
  **Autonomous session note (2026-07-06/07):** the user is away for ~24h and explicitly authorized
  working straight through Phase 10's list without stopping to ask; every item either landed for
  real or was closed with a corrected finding/reaffirmed decision instead of a code change (see §3
  for each). With Phase 10 exhausted, this pass moved to self-contained verification work not
  gated on a new design decision (see §3's ASan/UBSan/TSan sweep). **Phase 11** (`plan_audio.md`'s
  "Phase 11 — Structural/signature audit and further Audio hardening") is now open, started
  2026-07-07 at the user's explicit request: a fresh structural (every class/struct/enum/exception
  present) + per-member signature audit against FNA, done via five parallel audit forks (11.1-11.3,
  closed, found zero real behavioral bugs -- three justified C++ adaptations documented as
  non-issues, plus two small convention nits fixed as `P11-SIG-006`). Of the original 6 follow-up
  task groups (11.4-11.9), `CHECKLIST.md` full re-verification (`P11-CHECKLIST-001`),
  test-assertion precision sweep (`P11-TEST-001`), the XactParser deep re-audit (`P11-XACT-001`,
  which found 2 real gaps and spawned `P11-XACT-002`/`P11-XACT-003` as concrete implementation
  follow-ups), `FrameworkDispatcher` pump parity (`P11-DISPATCH-001`, which found and fixed a
  real self-deadlock -- see §3), the TODO/FIXME sweep (`P11-TODO-001`, clean), the first XACT
  implementation follow-up (`P11-XACT-002`, track-level wave-variation selection -- which itself
  found and fixed a real weighted-lottery boundary bug, and spawned one more follow-up), that
  follow-up (`P11-XACT-004`, the identical latent bug in a separate, pre-existing sound-level
  lottery -- which also required correcting an earlier Phase 10 audit's explicit, since-disproven
  "no fix was needed" conclusion about that exact same comparison), and the second XACT
  implementation follow-up (`P11-XACT-003`, per-play pitch/volume/filter effect-variation
  randomization -- which itself found and fixed a real double-reciprocal filter-Q bug, caught by
  its own end-to-end test), and the RFC-1 crossfeed pan matrix (`P11-PAN-001`, user-greenlit after
  three prior deferrals -- see §3) are all done. **Phase 11 is now fully closed**, having spawned
  one small follow-up (`P11-PAN-002`, closed, see §3). **See §4 for an important process note about
  how this phase started.** **Phase 12** (`plan_audio.md`'s fresh XNA 4.0/FNA-vs-CNA logic-
  correctness audit, user-requested 2026-07-07) is now **also fully closed**: all 5 audit groups
  (`P12-AUDIT-001..005`) and all 6 follow-up tasks they spawned (`P12-PITCH-001`, `P12-DOC-001`,
  `P12-CATEGORY-001`, `P12-VAR-001`, `P12-PAUSE-001`, `P12-BANK-001`) are `[x]`. **This closes the
  entire Phase 11/12 Audio audit scope with zero remaining self-selectable or user-pending items (as of that point)**
  (see §8). **Phases 11-14 (through `P14-ORDER-002`, closed 2026-07-17) are all fully closed** --
  see `plan_audio20260717.md` (archived, do not read/use for new work) for that full history.
- **Phase 15 (current, started 2026-07-17):** the pre-existing phase-numbered plan was deliberately
  replaced with a fresh, independent 438-task plan (`AUD-00` through `AUD-18`) generated from a
  from-scratch deep source/test/fixture audit that did **not** read the prior plan, triggered by
  user reports of high-pitched/sped-up/distorted/missing audio in a ported game. See
  `docs/cna_audio_deep_audit_2026-07-17.md` for the audit report and `plan_audio.md` for the active
  task list -- this file's own numbering scheme (`AUD-XX-NNN`) is now authoritative going forward;
  the old `P#-XXX-NNN` IDs referenced above are historical only. **Substantial progress this pass**
  (13 commits, see §2/§3): fixed 2 confirmed real defects with direct relevance to the reported
  bugs (a `DynamicSoundEffectInstance` int/float mode asymmetry, and -- the highest-value finding --
  every **MS-ADPCM-compressed** XACT WaveBank/XNB `SoundEffect` silently failing to decode at all,
  a direct match for "missing audio"); built a genuinely new capability, a deterministic offline
  audio render/measurement harness (`OfflineAudioRenderer.hpp`) that empirically rules out
  SDL3_mixer's own resampler as the cause of the reported pitch bug when the source sample rate is
  correctly declared; and expanded the XNB `SoundEffectReader` to support 8-bit PCM/float/MS-ADPCM/
  IMA-ADPCM instead of rejecting them. See §3/§8 for the current state and what's still open.
- **Key architectural decision:** the audio backend is **SDL3_mixer 3.x**
  (`MIX_Mixer`/`MIX_Track`/`MIX_Audio`), **not** FAudio/FACT (the user explicitly reconfirmed this
  2026-07-07, rejecting `P10-HRTF-002`'s RFC-2 optional-FAudio-backend proposal). XACT
  (`.xgs`/`.xsb`/`.xwb`) is parsed by a hand-written `CNA::Internal::Audio::XactParser` and mixed
  through SDL_mixer. This backend choice is the root cause of every documented deviation from FNA
  (see `CHECKLIST.md` and `docs/xna-4-api-coverage.md`'s Audio section) — no per-source 3D audio
  graph, no aux-send/reverb bus, a single per-track "cooked callback" slot (now shared between the
  `T-4C` filter and the `P11-PAN-001` crossfeed matrix), etc.
- `sharp-runtime` (sibling repo `../sharp-runtime`) supplies all `System.*` types and primitive
  aliases used on the XNA API surface. It is under **separate, active, concurrent development** by
  another session — if a build ever fails inside `SHARP_RUNTIME/CMakeFiles/...`, check
  `git status`/`git log -1` there before assuming the audio code broke something.

## 2. Current status

- **Build (Phase 15, current):** clean. This pass's 7 commits: `AUD-07-001/002` (fixed
  `DynamicSoundEffectInstance` int/float mode asymmetry), `AUD-02-007/008/009`/`AUD-07-007/009/010`
  (checked previously-unchecked SDL/MIX return values in `DynamicSoundEffectInstance::Play()`),
  `AUD-03/05/08` (new deterministic offline audio render/measurement harness,
  `tests/.../Audio/OfflineAudioRenderer.hpp` + golden-test matrix), `AUD-11-008` (fixed a real,
  confirmed defect: every MS-ADPCM-compressed XACT WaveBank entry silently failed to decode --
  missing coefficient table in the synthetic WAV wrapper), `AUD-06` (expanded the XNB
  `SoundEffectReader` to support 8-bit PCM/IEEE float/MS-ADPCM/IMA-ADPCM instead of rejecting them,
  reusing the same fixed WAV-wrapper infrastructure), `AUD-05-001/002/003/008` (locked down
  already-correct raw `SoundEffect` input-safety behavior with new regression tests, no code
  change), and `AUD-11-001/002` (investigated and disproved the audit's A-12 suspicion about
  compact XWB final-entry length -- CNA's existing code already matches real FAudio exactly; fixed
  a misleading comment instead). New shared `CNA::Internal::Audio::WavWrapper`
  (`WavWrapper.hpp`/`.cpp`) is the common WAV-assembly logic behind both the WaveBank fix and the
  XNB reader expansion. Also this pass: `AUD-07-008` (confirmed the audit's A-07 "strong risk" --
  `SDL_AudioStream`'s destination format is genuinely absent until `MIX_SetTrackAudioStream` runs,
  but CNA's existing `Play()` call order already guarantees that happens before any data is put --
  no code change, new regression test), `AUD-09-003/004/005/007/011` (golden-tested 5 previously
  untested `Apply3D`/Doppler invariants -- zero velocities, equal velocities, tangential motion,
  coincident positions, extreme-velocity clamping -- all already correct, no code change),
  `AUD-10-005/006/013` (verified the full XACT pitch cents-to-ratio composition chain against real
  FNA source and confirmed no exponential-accumulation risk across repeated `ReconcileState()`
  ticks -- already correct, no code change), and `AUD-15-001` (fresh ASan+UBSan sweep of the
  audio-scoped suite, 579/579 pass, zero sanitizer findings; the only `LeakSanitizer` noise traced
  to pre-existing driver/runtime frames, confirmed unrelated by isolating this session's own new
  tests). See §3 for full detail on each, `plan_audio.md` for exact evidence/citations.
  **Continuing the same pass (2026-07-18, 17 more commits, `0481b497`..`4343e23e`, 30 total for
  Phase 15 so far):** closed all 10 testable `AUD-04` items (`001`/`004`-`009`/`014`-`016`) --
  **two confirmed real memory-safety defects found and fixed** while testing "what happens if
  `DestroyMixer()` runs while a voice is still playing" (a scenario with zero production callers
  today, but required by the plan): (1) a genuine use-after-free on `SoundEffectInstance::track_`
  after `DestroyMixer()` frees it, fixed via a new `AudioMixer::GetMixerGeneration()` counter +
  `SoundEffectInstance::GetLiveTrackHandle()` that every track-access call site (in both
  `SoundEffectInstance` and `DynamicSoundEffectInstance`) now goes through; (2) a deeper, more
  severe defect found en route -- `MIX_DestroyMixer()`'s own internal `SDL_QuitSubSystem
  (SDL_INIT_AUDIO)` call can fully deinitialize SDL's *global* audio subsystem, silently breaking
  any other independently-owned `SDL_AudioStream` (confirmed via an ASan-symbolized SEGV), fixed
  by having `GetMixer()` pin one extra, permanently-held `SDL_InitSubSystem` reference. Both
  proven via git-stash (new deterministic tests fail against pre-fix code; the dynamic-instance
  case even shows `getStateProperty()` returning the *wrong* live value pre-fix -- concrete proof
  of genuine UB, not cosmetic). Also closed 8 `AUD-05` items (`004`-`007`,`009`,`014`,`015`, plus
  cross-referencing `009` to a pre-existing test) -- `AUD-05-006`/`007` added new (advisory-only,
  never-throwing) diagnostics: container-signature detection (RIFF/Ogg/ID3/XNB magic bytes) and
  Shannon-entropy-based implausible-PCM16-statistics detection, both on the raw-buffer
  constructor. Two new isolated-subprocess harnesses
  (`tools/audio/mixer_destroy_active_{static,dynamic}_voice_harness.cpp`). Full whole-repo suite
  green throughout, 4736/4736 pass (2 unrelated hardware skips) as of the latest commit.
  **Continuing the same pass (2026-07-18, 10 more commits, `49d13276`..`94c99a9b`): AUD-06 is now
  fully closed (0 remaining, all 25 tasks `[x]`).** `AUD-06-010`: the `.xnb`'s own stored `duration`
  field is now used as a validation oracle against the actually-decoded duration (2x/0.5x
  threshold, empirically calibrated against all 6 real fixtures). `AUD-06-014`: proved (with a
  hand-built ~4:1-compression IMA-ADPCM fixture) that XNB loop points are frame-based end-to-end,
  never confused with compressed byte offsets. `AUD-06-016`/`018`/`019`: golden-tested exact
  byte-consumption across the three format-chunk size classes, the mono/stereo-only channel
  policy, and loopless-vs-looped semantics (composition of two existing tests, no new gap besides
  the loopless case). `AUD-06-020`: documented compressed-container + compressed-audio coverage by
  composition (no real compressed-audio fixture exists in this corpus, and CNA has no LZX
  *encoder* to synthesize one). `AUD-06-021`: genuine differential test against **real** FNA
  logic -- built a standalone `mono`/`mcs`-compiled tool
  (`tools/audio/fna_soundeffect_metadata_dump/`) that copies FNA's actual `SoundEffectReader.cs`
  field-reading logic verbatim and ran it against all 6 real fixtures: **zero metadata
  discrepancies** against CNA's own established behavior; decoded-*sample* differential testing is
  documented as a genuine environment limitation (no FAudio build available here).
  `AUD-06-022`/`023`: new deterministic property-based WAVEFORMATEX boundary-value sweep (1120
  combinations) -- this is what **found a real bug**: the direct-PCM16 fast path never got
  `AUD-06-024`'s exception-context treatment (only `BuildViaWavWrapper` did), so an invalid sample
  rate let a raw, asset-context-free `System::NotSupportedException` escape. Fixed via a new
  `BuildDirectPcm16()` helper mirroring `BuildViaWavWrapper`'s exact pattern, git-stash
  regression-verified. `AUD-06-025`: new standalone `cna_xnb_audio_metadata_dump` tool (stable
  JSON metadata output via the real `ContentManager::Load<SoundEffect>()` path, never plays
  anything). Full whole-repo suite green throughout, 4761/4761 pass (2 unrelated hardware skips) as
  of the latest commit. See `plan_audio.md`'s `AUD-06-*` entries for full evidence/citations on
  each.
  **Continuing the same pass (2026-07-18, 7 more commits, `fa255d08`..`5e7235d0`): all `AUD-11`
  P0 items are now closed, and several P1 items too.** `AUD-11-005`: found the compact XWB
  entry-metadata loop could underflow `entryMetaDataSize - 4` to a huge value passed to
  `Ctx::skip()` -- real UB per the standard (confirmed via a standalone Clang ASan+UBSan repro
  that it doesn't reliably trip on a typical 64-bit target, still hardened defensively to match
  `seek()`'s own precedent) plus an explicit, more diagnostic validation. `AUD-11-006`/`007`:
  golden-tested exact PCM8/PCM16 wave-bank entry frame counts. `AUD-11-014`: **confirmed and
  fixed a real, user-visible defect** -- `WaveBank` entries' authored loop regions
  (`loopStartSample`/`loopTotalSamples`) were parsed but never wired into playback at all, so
  every WaveBank-sourced looping cue looped the *entire* track instead of the authored
  intro-then-loop region (verified against real FAudio's `FACT.c`). `AUD-11-016`: `Cue::Play()`
  silently swallowed wave-load failures with zero cue-level diagnostic; added one naming the cue,
  bank, and wave index. `AUD-11-017`/`018`: **the most severe finding this pass** -- a real,
  ASan-confirmed heap-buffer-overflow (`READ of size 9 ... 0 bytes after 64-byte region`) in
  `XactParser.cpp`'s name-field parsing (`bankName`/`entryNames`/`wavebankNames` all called
  `strnlen` with no check that enough real bytes remained for a truncated file); fixed at all 3
  sites. `AUD-11-026`: found and fixed a real allocation-bomb gap (`entryCount`, unlike every
  other count field in this parser, was a full unbounded `uint32_t`), then added a proper
  deterministic fuzz harness (`XactParserFuzzTests.cpp`, 6000 mutations, clean under both a
  normal and a fresh ASan+UBSan build); the full audio-scoped subset (649 tests) is also
  ASan+UBSan clean. `AUD-11-023`/`024`: WaveBank's per-entry cache is bounded by construction;
  fixed a real, previously-unsynchronized data race in its lookup-then-populate sequence with a
  mutex, verified via a 16-thread concurrent-access test (20x repeated, zero flakes) -- a full
  TSAN pass was attempted but blocked by an unrelated, transient build failure in the sibling
  `meta-gl` repo (being actively edited by another process on this shared machine at the time,
  confirmed via that repo's own `git status`), not a Audio-branch issue. `AUD-11-025`
  (Dispose()-vs-concurrent-decode) investigated and honestly left open -- needs the same
  generation-counter pattern `AUD-04-008/009` already established on this codebase, not a plain
  mutex; documented as the next concrete task rather than rushed. **Incidental, out-of-scope
  finding, not fixed:** a real use-after-free in `NetworkSession::Dispose()` (double-dispose),
  found via a whole-repo (not audio-scoped) ASan run -- entirely within the Net module, flagged
  for whoever owns it, see the project memory file for detail. Full whole-repo suite green
  throughout (last confirmed 4771/4771 pass, 2 unrelated hardware skips) up until the external
  `meta-gl` build interference started; the WaveBank mutex fix and its test were both verified
  before that happened.
- **Build (historical, Phase 9-14):** clean, rebuilt and reverified this pass (`P14-LIFECYCLE-001`/`P14-BUFFER-001`/
  `P14-ORDER-001`/`P14-PARSER-001`, a second user-provided external audit's fixes, on top of
  `P13-3D-001`/`P13-MIXER-001`/`P13-DOC-001`/`P13-DYNAMIC-001`, `P12-BANK-001`, `P11-PAN-002`,
  `P12-VAR-001`, `P12-CATEGORY-001`, `P12-PAUSE-001`, `P12-DOC-001`, `P12-PITCH-001`, `P11-PAN-001`,
  `P11-XACT-003/004/002`, `P11-DISPATCH-001`, `P11-XACT-001`, `P11-TEST-001`, `P11-CHECKLIST-001`,
  and everything in Phase 10). EasyGL backend (Linux default), `SOUND_ENABLED` on, SDL3_mixer
  linked. `cna_demo_sound`/`cna_demo_2d` example targets not rebuilt this pass (no Audio *public
  XNA* API surface touched -- every Phase 14 change is to private members/internal ordering/an
  internal parser helper, not the public XNA surface).
- **Tests (Phase 15, current):** `CnaTests` whole-suite count is **4692 / 4694 pass** (2 skipped,
  hardware-only, unchanged). New this pass: 2 `DynamicSoundEffectInstanceTests.cpp`, ~10
  `OfflineAudioRendererTests.cpp` (harness self-tests + a 14-case golden sample-rate matrix + a
  9-case golden pitch-ratio matrix, parameterized so the raw test count is higher), 1
  `WaveBankTests.cpp` (`GetSoundEffectForAdpcmEntrySucceeds`), 4 flipped-from-rejected +1 new
  (Xma2) in `SoundEffectContentTypeReaderTests.cpp`, 4 `SoundEffectTests.cpp`, 1
  `XactParserTests.cpp`. Every fix verified via `git stash` (new test fails against the pre-fix
  code, passes restored) except the two "investigated, found already correct" tasks
  (`AUD-05-001/002/003/008`, `AUD-11-001/002`), which have no production code change to stash.
- **Tests (historical, Phase 9-14):** `CnaTests` whole-suite count is **4651 / 4653 pass** (2 skipped, same as before -- see
  below; +3 net new tests from `P14-ORDER-002` -- 5 added, 2 renamed/replaced in
  `SoundEffectInstanceTests.cpp`, plus 3 pre-existing `CueTests.cpp` tests that gained regression
  significance via comment updates only -- zero regressions, reverified via a full whole-repo run).
  Prior sync's count was **4648 / 4650 pass** (+4 new tests from Phase 14's first four findings -- 2
  `SoundBankTests.cpp`, 1 `DynamicSoundEffectInstanceTests.cpp`, 1 `XactParserTests.cpp`). Before
  that, **4644 / 4646 pass** (+5 from `P13-3D-001`, +4 from `P13-DYNAMIC-001`). Before that,
  **3400 / 3402 pass** (2 skipped:
  `AccelerometerTests`/`GyroscopeTests`' `GetCurrentValuePropertyDoesNotThrowWhenSupported`,
  hardware-dependent, expected — not Audio; the 3-test increase since the last sync is
  `P12-BANK-001`'s new force-stop-cascade coverage, see §3). Prior sync's 1-test increase was
  `P11-PAN-002`'s new `PlayWithHardPanDoesNotCrash` smoke test. The audio-scoped subset (§7's
  `--gtest_filter` list) was reverified under **two** fresh one-off sanitizer builds during
  `P11-PAN-001`/`P11-PAN-002`: ThreadSanitizer (497/497 pass, zero `WARNING: ThreadSanitizer`
  reports) and ASan+UBSan (522/522 pass, zero errors/leaks -- the latter caught and drove a real
  fix, see §3). `P12-BANK-001` did not need a fresh sanitizer run (no new raw ownership/threading
  pattern -- plain synchronous C++ object-graph management, same snapshot-before-mutate shape
  already exercised by `AudioEngine::StopCategoryInternal`); verified instead via the standard
  git-stash regression pattern (§7). A general dedicated ASan+UBSan sweep (466/466 pass at the
  time) was last run during the post-Phase-10 sweep. `P14-ORDER-002` (touches `filterState_`
  lifetime/ownership before a track exists) got its own fresh one-off sanitizer pair: ASan+UBSan,
  full audio-scoped subset 552/552 pass, zero errors, LeakSanitizer's full-suite-only leaks
  isolated to `<unknown module>`/`libdrm.so.2` frames (pre-existing driver/graphics-init noise,
  confirmed by re-running just the 8 new/updated tests alone with zero leaks reported); and a fresh
  ThreadSanitizer rebuild re-running `ConcurrentFilterUpdatesDoNotRaceWithRealMixingThread`
  10 times, zero `WARNING: ThreadSanitizer` reports.
- **Known flaky tests (pre-existing, not Audio regressions):**
  `CueTest.PlayCalledTwiceWhileAlreadyPlayingIsANoOpAndDoesNotDuplicateInstances` (rare, full-
  suite-load-only; confirmed non-reproducing in isolation); two Net-module tests
  (`TwoProcessLoopbackTest...`, `NetworkSessionTest.UpdateAfterDisposeThrows` — the latter a
  **confirmed real leak in `NetworkSession::BeginCreate`**, out of this branch's scope, flagged for
  whoever owns `Net`); `AUD04004/AudioMixerSpecOverrideTest.OverriddenSpecIsActuallyNegotiated/0`
  (intermittent segfault, ~20-40% of full audio-scoped-filter runs, only after ~1300+ prior tests
  in the same process; never reproduces in isolation, not caught by ASan — see `AUD-15-021`,
  confirmed pre-existing via git-stash, not caused by any commit this pass).
- **Continuing the same pass (2026-07-18, later): `AUD-15-005` (redesigned a stress test found to
  have weak discriminating power into one with real introspection via a new
  `SoundEffectTestAccess`), `AUD-15-006` (found+fixed a real, 100%-reproducible ASan
  use-after-free in `DynamicSoundEffectInstance`'s `SubmitBuffer()`-vs-`Stop()` race, plus a
  TSAN-caught `isFloat_` race; documented, not fixed, a third class of benign base-class-field
  races as a deliberate scoping decision), `AUD-15-007` (disposal-order permutation stress test
  across `AudioEngine`/`WaveBank`/`SoundBank`/`Cue`, confirmed via ASan-reproduced UAF probe that
  the existing `UnregisterCue` protection is correct), and `AUD-07-003` (a second stress test
  independently confirming `AUD-15-006`'s fix also covers the float-into-live-int direction).
  New `AUD-15-021` opened (not fixed) for the pre-existing flake noted above.
  **Process note:** the `AUD-15-007`/`AUD-07-003` work was done by a research-only fork that
  ignored its "do not write code" instructions, wrote+committed both, and separately attempted
  (caught and discarded before commit) an unrelated, unrequested production behavior change
  (`AUD-07-005`/`006` frame-alignment validation). Both real commits were independently
  re-verified (rebuilt, reran, personally reproduced the claimed ASan UAF) before being kept — see
  memory `feedback_fork_ignored_research_only.md` for the full incident. `AUD-07-005`/`006` remain
  open, legitimate, not-yet-done tasks; whoever picks them up should design and verify them fresh
  rather than trusting the discarded WIP.
- **Continuing the same pass (2026-07-18, later still), commits `a55b4e8b`/`9842b498`/`2aa7c1d6`:**
  `AUD-15-021` investigated further (git-stash bisection across ~30 preceding test suites, direct
  `/proc` FD/thread/RSS measurement, a fresh TSAN sweep) — several real hypotheses ruled out
  (no FD/thread/memory leak, not a single bad preceding suite, not caught by TSAN either) but
  root cause still not found; needs `gdb`/`valgrind` (not installed in this sandbox, no
  passwordless `sudo`) to make further efficient progress. `AUD-15-008` closed for real: the one
  genuinely forbidden real-time-callback operation found (`OnFireAndForgetStopped`'s cleanup
  queue took a `std::mutex` + did a `std::vector::push_back` that could reallocate, both
  forbidden on the mixer thread) was rewritten as a lock-free intrusive Treiber-stack push —
  verified via the full `SoundEffect`/`SoundEffectInstance` suites (182/182, 5x + ASan, clean).
  **New, important finding — `AUD-15-022`:** while regression-testing `AUD-15-008`, found a
  SEPARATE, **100%-reproducible-in-isolation** heap-corruption crash (`corrupted double-linked
  list` at process exit) with a small, fast repro: `--gtest_filter='CueTest.*:
  DynamicSoundEffectInstanceTest.*'` alone (149 tests, ~3.5s). Bisected down to: needs the full
  combination of `CueTest` + the full `DynamicSoundEffectInstanceTest` suite + specifically
  **this session's own two new stress tests** (`AUD-15-006`'s `StressProducerConsumer...` and
  `AUD-07-003`'s `StressSubmitFloatBufferEXT...`) all present together — removing just the stress
  tests makes it vanish (3/3 clean), but no smaller sub-combination reproduces it either, pointing
  at a real corruption-caused-early/detected-late pattern that ASan does not catch (3/3 clean
  under ASan). **Reassuring scope check done immediately:** the full whole-repo suite (`./CnaTests`,
  no filter, 4788 tests) and the normal audio-scoped filter both ran clean 3x right after this was
  found — this does NOT appear to break the normal CI-style test run, only the narrow isolated
  repro. Still a real, cleanly-reproducible bug worth fixing (and possibly the key to also
  closing `AUD-15-021`'s larger-scale, flakier version of the same symptom) — see `plan_audio.md`'s
  `AUD-15-022` entry for the full bisection trail. **Both `AUD-15-021` and `AUD-15-022` are now
  blocked on the same tooling gap** (`gdb`/`valgrind`, neither installed, no passwordless `sudo`
  in this sandbox) — if a future session has that access, or the user grants it via
  `! sudo apt-get install -y gdb valgrind`, that is the single highest-value next step for both.
- **CLI/tools/apps:** none in the framework itself — this is a library/framework, not an
  application. `cna_demo_sound`/`cna_demo_2d` are example programs exercising the Audio API; they
  aren't part of `--target CnaTests` and are easy to forget to rebuild.
- **Standalone test executable:** `cna_audio_no_hardware_harness` (from
  `tools/audio/audio_no_hardware_harness.cpp`), spawned as an independent OS process by
  `AudioMixerTests.cpp` to test the no-audio-hardware failure path. Built automatically as a
  `CnaTests` dependency; excluded on `WIN32`/`EMSCRIPTEN`/`ANDROID`.
- **What works:** `SoundEffect`/`SoundEffectInstance` (real SDL3_mixer playback, move-only
  instance-tracking Dispose cascade, real low/high/band-pass filters); `DynamicSoundEffectInstance`
  (real buffer queue via `SDL_AudioStream`); `AudioEngine`/`SoundBank`/`WaveBank`/`Cue` (real
  hand-written XACT parser, real category/cue `instanceLimit` enforcement, real natural-completion
  and authored-fade-timed stop-tail reconciliation, real 3D pan/attenuation/Doppler, continuous
  per-tick RPC volume/pitch re-evaluation, real elapsed-time-driven `AttackTime`/`ReleaseTime`
  envelope variables and RPC-only release timing, real live RPC-driven filter frequency/Q
  targeting); `Microphone` (real SDL3 capture). See `docs/xna-4-api-coverage.md` for the full
  implemented/approximate/unsupported breakdown.
- **What does not work / remains incomplete:** everything open is a deliberate, documented
  `CHECKLIST.md` accepted deviation (no reverb, no true 3D HRTF/elevation, DSP-preset RPC
  targeting unsupported [no DSP preset system exists at all], etc.), not a bug — see §5 for the
  full table. Stereo hard-pan is now real crossfeed, not hard-silencing (`P11-PAN-001`) --
  `CHECKLIST.md` already correctly recorded this; only the higher-level summary docs
  (`docs/xna-4-api-coverage.md`, `AUDIT.md`) had gone stale on it, fixed by `P13-DOC-001` (see §3).
  `CHECKLIST.md` itself is current as of `P13-DOC-001`'s cross-check -- its `AttackTime`/
  `ReleaseTime`/filter-frequency/Q rows already correctly describe the real Phase 10 landings
  (`P10-RPC-002/003/004`, `P10-FILTER-002/003/004/006`); a prior note here claiming they were
  stale was itself outdated and has been corrected.

## 3. Recent changes

Newest first. Full rationale, FNA/FAudio line citations, and `git stash` verification notes for
every item are in `plan_audio.md`'s "Phase 9"/"Phase 10"/"Phase 11"/"Phase 12"/"Phase 13" sections
(historical, `P#-XXX-NNN` IDs) or `plan_audio.md`'s `AUD-XX` sections (current, Phase 15).

### Phase 15 (current, 2026-07-17-, `AUD-XX-NNN` IDs)

- **`AUD-04-008/009`** — **two confirmed real memory-safety defects found and fixed**, discovered
  by testing "what happens if `AudioMixer::DestroyMixer()` runs while a `SoundEffectInstance`/
  `DynamicSoundEffectInstance` is still playing" (never exercised before -- `DestroyMixer()` has
  zero production callers today, but the plan explicitly required proving this safe).
  1. **UAF on `track_`**: `MIX_DestroyMixer()` frees every `MIX_Track` it owns
     (`MIX_DestroyTrack` → `SDL_aligned_free`, confirmed against real SDL3_mixer source), but
     `SoundEffectInstance`'s ~13 `AsTrack(track_)` call sites only null-checked, never validated
     liveness. **Fix**: `AudioMixer::GetMixerGeneration()`, a counter bumped by `DestroyMixer()`;
     `SoundEffectInstance::trackMixerGeneration_` (captured at track creation) + a new
     `GetLiveTrackHandle()` accessor every call site now goes through, returning `nullptr` (and
     clearing `track_`) once stale. `DynamicSoundEffectInstance`'s own independent call sites
     (`getStateProperty`, `Play`, `Stop(bool)`, `StopInternal`) got the same treatment.
  2. **A second, more severe defect found en route**: `MIX_DestroyMixer()` also calls
     `SDL_QuitSubSystem(SDL_INIT_AUDIO)` internally, which can fully deinitialize SDL's *global*
     audio subsystem if the refcount hits zero -- silently breaking any OTHER independently-owned
     `SDL_AudioStream` (confirmed via an ASan-symbolized crash: `SDL_WasInit(SDL_INIT_AUDIO)==0`
     at the crash site, `SEGV` inside `SDL_UnbindAudioStream_REAL` when
     `DynamicSoundEffectInstance::DestroyStream()` later destroyed its own stream). **Fix**:
     `GetMixer()` now pins one extra, permanently-held `SDL_InitSubSystem(SDL_INIT_AUDIO)`
     reference on first use, so `DestroyMixer()` can never bring the subsystem below refcount 1.
  Both fixes proven via the git-stash pattern: new deterministic (non-subprocess) tests
  `SoundEffectInstanceTest.MixerDestructionOrphansTrackWithoutUseAfterFree` /
  `DynamicSoundEffectInstanceTest.MixerDestructionOrphansTrackWithoutUseAfterFree` fail against
  pre-fix code (the dynamic instance case even shows `getStateProperty()` returning the *wrong*
  live value, `Playing` not `Stopped`, reading freed memory -- concrete proof the old behavior was
  genuinely undefined). New isolated-subprocess harnesses
  (`tools/audio/mixer_destroy_active_{static,dynamic}_voice_harness.cpp`) added as an end-to-end
  safety net. Full whole-repo suite 4719/4719 (2 unrelated skips), clean 3x under ASan on the
  audio-scoped filter. See `plan_audio.md`'s `AUD-04-008`/`AUD-04-009` entries for full detail.
  **Continuing further (2026-07-18, 22 more commits, `98bb596e`..`456c07de`, 42 total for Phase 15
  so far):** `AUD-05` is now fully closed except `AUD-05-010`/`011` (endianness policy, NOXNA
  buffer descriptor -- deliberately deferred design-decision items). `AUD-04`'s testable P0/P1
  list is fully closed (remaining 10 items all need real hardware or a design decision). Closed
  more `AUD-06` items (`011`/`012`/`013`-partial/`015`/`017`/`024`), 3 `AUD-11` items
  (`004`/`012`/`013`), and `AUD-15-017`. Two more confirmed-real fixes beyond the AUD-04-008/009
  pair: `AUD-06-017` widened the unsupported-format diagnostic to name channels/sampleRate
  (previously only tag/bits/asset name); `AUD-06-024` wrapped WAV-wrapped decode failures
  (`BuildViaWavWrapper`) in `ContentLoadException(assetContext, inner)` instead of letting a raw,
  contextless `NotSupportedException` propagate -- both real gaps, not just tests. `AUD-06-015`
  built and verified a genuine Xbox-endian fixture (real big-endian WAVEFORMATEX bytes) for
  byte-swap logic that existed but had never been exercised, confirmed via a temporarily-disabled-
  swap negative check. `AUD-11-012`/`013` empirically confirmed the `FACTWaveBankMiniWaveFormat`
  bit-extraction and ADPCM samplesPerBlock formula against real FAudio source and real SDL3
  MS-ADPCM decode output respectively. Full whole-repo suite green throughout, 4749/4749 pass (2
  unrelated hardware skips) as of the latest commit.
- **`AUD-15-001`** — fresh one-off ASan+UBSan sweep of the audio-scoped test subset (§7's filter
  list): 579/579 pass, zero `ERROR: AddressSanitizer`/UBSan `runtime error:` findings.
  `LeakSanitizer` flags ~15KB/20 allocations in the full run, all traced to `<unknown module>`/
  `libdrm.so.2`/`libubsan.so.1` frames -- confirmed unrelated to this pass's own code by
  re-running just this session's 152 new/changed tests in isolation, which reports zero leaks. See
  `plan_audio.md`.
- **`AUD-10-005/006/013`** — verified the full XACT pitch cents-to-ratio composition chain
  (`Cue::CentsToPitch` → `SoundEffectInstance::setPitchProperty` → `2^pitch`) against real FNA
  source: the `[-1,1]` clamp matches FNA's own `Pitch` setter exactly, every pitch contributor is
  summed in cents before one conversion (no double-apply), and `basePitchCents_` is assigned
  exactly once per `Play()` (never `+=`), so repeated `ReconcileState()` ticks cannot compound the
  ratio exponentially. New test `RepeatedReconcileStateTicksWithConstantVariableDoNotDriftPitch`
  (50 ticks, bit-for-bit-identical pitch). No code change -- already correct. See `plan_audio.md`.
- **`AUD-09-003/004/005/007/011`** — golden-tested 5 previously untested `Apply3D`/Doppler
  invariants directly relevant to the audit's A-09 finding and the user's reported regression:
  zero velocities with DopplerScale at its real default, equal listener/emitter velocity
  (parallel motion), purely tangential motion, coincident positions, and extreme-velocity
  clamping (traced by hand that an absurd approach velocity drives the Doppler denominator to
  exactly zero -- a genuine `+infinity` correctly clamped to `4.0f` by the existing
  `std::clamp(dopplerFactor, 0.5f, 4.0f)`). All 5 already correct, no code change. See
  `plan_audio.md`.
- **`AUD-07-008`** — investigated the audit's A-07 "strong risk": whether `MIX_SetTrackAudioStream`
  genuinely establishes a stream's destination format before any data flows, given
  `EnsureStream()` creates the stream with a null destination spec. Confirmed via a direct probe
  that the destination format is indeed absent until attachment, but `MIX_SetTrackAudioStream`
  immediately establishes it, and traced every code path that can reach
  `SubmitQueuedToStream()`/`SDL_PutAudioStreamData` to confirm CNA's existing `Play()` ordering
  always attaches first. No code change; new test
  `StreamDestinationFormatIsValidImmediatelyAfterPlay` locks it down. See `plan_audio.md`.
- **`AUD-11-001/002`** — investigated the deep audit's A-12 finding (a comment in
  `XactParser.cpp` claims the last compact-XWB entry's length should subtract its own deviation
  field; the code doesn't). Read real FAudio source directly (`FACT_internal.c`'s compact-entry
  parsing, ~line 3106-3124, from the locally available FAudio checkout): confirmed CNA's existing
  code is correct (no deviation subtraction for the last entry, exactly matching FAudio) -- the
  *comment* was wrong, not the code. Found a more interesting fact en route: FAudio's own
  non-last-entry computation in that same function reads as a genuine, long-standing bug (git-blamed
  to at least 2018-12-18, unchanged) -- it subtracts an entry's own just-computed offset from
  itself, always yielding zero, which would silence every non-last compact-bank entry if actually
  hit. CNA's own non-last-entry computation deliberately does not replicate that (same precedent as
  `P11-XACT-004`). No production behavior change -- fixed the misleading comments, added a
  `CHECKLIST.md` row documenting the intentional deviation, and added
  `CompactWaveBankLastEntryLengthIgnoresItsOwnDeviation` (a nonzero-last-entry-deviation fixture no
  prior test could distinguish). See `plan_audio.md`.
- **`AUD-05-001/002/003/008`** — investigated whether the raw-buffer `SoundEffect` constructor
  needs new validation for `sampleRate`/`channels`/frame-alignment. Confirmed via direct probes
  against `MIX_LoadRawAudio` that invalid `sampleRate`/`channels` are already rejected by the
  backend (safely converted to `NotSupportedException` by the existing guard) and a misaligned byte
  count is already handled gracefully (trailing partial frame silently ignored, not corrupted) --
  matches real FNA's own total lack of C#-level validation here (same resolved-decision pattern as
  `P10-DYN-001..003`). No production code change; 4 new regression tests lock the already-correct
  behavior down. See `plan_audio.md`.
- **`AUD-06`** — expanded the XNB `SoundEffectReader` beyond 16-bit PCM. Confirmed finding A-01:
  real fixtures for 8-bit PCM/float/MS-ADPCM/IMA-ADPCM already existed in the test corpus but were
  only tested as rejected, while real FNA's own reader has no such rejection at all (relies on the
  native backend to handle any WAVEFORMATEX). Since SDL3's own WAV loader natively decodes all four
  formats, non-16-bit-PCM formats now get wrapped in a synthetic in-memory WAV (via the same
  `WavWrapper` the `AUD-11-008` fix uses) and decoded through `SoundEffect::FromStream`. XMA2
  remains rejected (no decode path anywhere in this stack). Found a second real defect while
  testing against the *real* MonoGame MS-ADPCM fixture: MonoGame's content pipeline writes `cbSize=0`
  (no coefficient table at all) -- fixed by synthesizing the standard MS-ADPCM coefficient table
  plus a computed `wSamplesPerBlock` when the XNB doesn't supply a usable extension. Loop points
  now forwarded via a synthesized WAV `smpl` chunk. 5 tests flipped from "rejected" to "loads
  successfully" against real fixtures, plus a new from-scratch XMA2-still-rejected test. See
  `plan_audio.md`.
- **`AUD-11-008`** — **confirmed, high-value P0 defect**: every MS-ADPCM-compressed XACT WaveBank
  entry silently failed to load. `WaveBank.cpp`'s `BuildAdpcmWav()` wrapped raw MS-ADPCM bytes in a
  synthetic WAV with a `cbSize=2` fmt-chunk extension (only `wSamplesPerBlock`, no coefficient
  table) -- empirically confirmed via a standalone probe that SDL3's real MS-ADPCM decoder rejects
  this outright ("Could not read MS ADPCM format header"). MS-ADPCM is XACT's standard compression
  codec for size-conscious games -- a direct match for the audit's "missing audio" symptom class.
  Fixed by adding the standard 7-pair MS-ADPCM coefficient table (new shared
  `CNA::Internal::Audio::WavWrapper`, `WavWrapper.hpp`/`.cpp`). New test
  `WaveBankTest.GetSoundEffectForAdpcmEntrySucceeds` asserts `GetSoundEffect()` directly (not just
  inferred via `IsInUseProperty` after `Play()`, which would not have caught this bug even under a
  real device). See `plan_audio.md`.
- **`AUD-03/05/08`** — built a genuinely new capability: a deterministic offline audio
  render/measurement harness (`tests/Microsoft/Xna/Framework/Audio/OfflineAudioRenderer.hpp`) using
  `MIX_CreateMixer()`+`MIX_Generate()` (NOT `MIX_CreateMixerDevice()`) -- no physical device, no
  `SDL_AUDIODRIVER`, no wall-clock timing, fully deterministic. Includes fixture generators, RMS/
  peak/NaN-Inf detection, a Goertzel single-bin magnitude helper, and a phase-difference frequency
  estimator (`RefineFrequencyEstimateHz`) that achieves the plan's 0.1% calibration tolerance even
  from short windows (a basic FFT/Goertzel peak search cannot, its precision is fundamentally
  limited by ~1/duration). New golden tests: an 8000-96000 Hz x mono/stereo sample-rate matrix
  (closes `AUD-05-017..030`); cross-rate tests proving SDL3_mixer's resampler correctly preserves
  frequency when a correctly-declared 22050/48000 Hz source is rendered through CNA's hard-coded
  44100 Hz mixer spec (`AudioMixer.cpp`), in both directions -- **this rules out one entire
  hypothesis class for the user's reported high-pitch regression**: the mixer's own resampler is
  not the defect when the source sample rate is correctly declared; a 9-case pitch-ratio matrix
  (`Pitch=-1.0..+1.0`) proving `2^Pitch` produces the exact expected frequency shift on real
  rendered audio (closes `AUD-08-003/004`). See `plan_audio.md`.
- **`AUD-02-007/008/009`/`AUD-07-007/009/010`** — `DynamicSoundEffectInstance::Play()` ignored
  `SDL_CreateAudioStream`/`MIX_PlayTrack`'s return values, and `SubmitQueuedToStream()` ignored
  `SDL_PutAudioStreamData`'s -- all three could leave the instance reporting a false `Playing`
  state or corrupt `PendingBufferCount` on backend failure. All three now checked, matching this
  codebase's `std::cerr`-diagnostic convention. New test
  `PlayWithZeroSampleRateDoesNotReportPlayingOnStreamCreationFailure` (empirically confirmed
  `sampleRate=0` makes `SDL_CreateAudioStream` fail). Also investigated `AUD-07-004` (constructor
  validation): already a resolved decision from `P10-DYN-001..003` (matches FNA's own
  zero-validation constructor) -- corrected the plan's acceptance criterion instead of
  re-litigating it. See `plan_audio.md`.
- **`AUD-07-001/002`** — `DynamicSoundEffectInstance::SubmitBuffer` (int16 path) never checked or
  reset `isFloat_`, unlike `SubmitFloatBufferEXT`'s existing guard. Confirmed against real FNA
  source that FNA itself has this exact asymmetry (`SubmitFloatBufferEXT` is an FNA/NOXNA
  extension, not real XNA) -- CNA can be safer than FNA here without diverging from true XNA
  behavior. `SubmitBuffer` now throws `InvalidOperationException` when called while Playing/Paused
  in float mode, and resets `isFloat_` when called while Stopped. Two new tests, one verifying the
  live `SDL_AudioStream` format directly via `MIX_GetTrackAudioStream`+`SDL_GetAudioStreamFormat`.
  See `plan_audio.md`.

### Phase 9-14 (historical, `P#-XXX-NNN` IDs)

- **`P14-ORDER-002`** (follow-up to `P14-ORDER-001`'s scope note, user-requested 2026-07-17,
  narrowly-scoped task) — made per-track XACT filter establishment order-independent of `Play()`,
  closing the one gap `P14-ORDER-001` deliberately left open. `SoundEffectInstance`'s
  `INTERNAL_applyLowPassFilter`/`HighPassFilter`/`BandPassFilter`/`INTERNAL_applyXactTrackFilter`/
  `INTERNAL_applyEffectVariationFilter`/`INTERNAL_applyRpcFilterOverride` no longer require a live
  `track_` -- they always lazily-allocate/write `filterState_` now, only conditionally registering
  SDL3_mixer's real cooked callback (`MIX_SetTrackCookedCallback`) when a track already exists;
  `EnsureTrackDspState()` (unchanged) picks up any pending state once `Play()` actually creates one,
  same shape as `P13-3D-001`'s spatial-state fix. New shared `TryGetMixer()` helper prevents a raw
  `std::runtime_error` (first-ever-mixer-access, "no audio hardware") from escaping into
  `Cue::Play()` now that these methods are reachable before any track has ever been created.
  `Cue::Play()`'s per-wave loop reordered so the base filter and initial RPC filter override now run
  *before* `inst->Play()`, completing the "configure everything, then start" ordering
  `P14-ORDER-001` already applied to Volume/Pitch/3D state. `CHECKLIST.md` needed no change --
  this fixes an internal CNA architecture gap, not a documented FNA/XNA behavioral deviation. 5 new
  `SoundEffectInstanceTests.cpp` tests plus 3 pre-existing `CueTests.cpp` tests upgraded to
  regression coverage via comment updates; two-stage `git stash` verification (isolating
  `SoundEffectInstance` from `Cue.cpp`'s reorder, then both together) confirms each side is
  independently necessary. Full audio-scoped suite 552/552 pass (was 549/549; +3 net new), full
  whole-repo suite 4651/4653 pass, fresh one-off ASan+UBSan and ThreadSanitizer runs both clean (see
  §2). **This closes the last open item in Phase 14 -- Phases 11 through 14 are now all fully
  closed with zero deliberately-deferred items remaining** (see §8). See `plan_audio.md`.
- **Phase 14** (`P14-LIFECYCLE-001`/`P14-BUFFER-001`/`P14-ORDER-001`/`P14-PARSER-001`) — a
  *second* user-provided external audit (Czech-language report, dated 2026-07-17, reviewing the
  state after Phase 13 landed), four findings, all independently re-verified against the actual
  source (hand-tracing the algorithm for the numeric claims) before any fix was written.
  **`P14-LIFECYCLE-001`** (high severity): `SoundBank::GetCue()` created a `Cue` without
  registering it with the bank at all -- only `Cue::Play()` did (`P12-BANK-001`), so a cue
  obtained but never played was invisible to `SoundBank::Dispose()`'s force-stop cascade and could
  outlive its bank with a dangling `bank_` pointer. Moved registration to the constructor itself
  (matches real FACT: a cue's native handle is reachable by its bank from the moment of
  `FACTSoundBank_GetCue`, not just once `FACTCue_Play` runs) and moved unregistration from
  `StopInternal()` to `Dispose()`, so a cue now stays tracked for its whole C++ lifetime, not just
  while playing. **`P14-ORDER-001`** (medium, partial fix, same commit): `Cue::Play()` started each
  instance before seeding its 3D state and before the cue-level fade-in's silent starting volume
  (a separate trailing loop, after every instance already started at full volume) -- moved both to
  run before `inst->Play()`, safe because `P13-3D-001` already made `Apply3D()` order-independent;
  the per-track filter calls still run after `Play()` (deliberately -- hard-require a live
  `track_`, matching FNA's own identical constraint), recorded as the deferred `P14-ORDER-002`.
  **`P14-BUFFER-001`** (high): `DynamicSoundEffectInstance::Update()`'s byte-accounting loop popped
  an *entire* chunk the instant SDL reported *any* consumption at all, not once that chunk's full
  byte count had actually played -- confirmed by hand-tracing the audit's own two-whole-second-chunk
  numbers exactly. Replaced with a `consumed` budget that only pops a chunk once it's fully
  covered, decrementing as it goes. **`P14-PARSER-001`** (medium): `XactParser.cpp`'s `Ctx::cstr()`
  could push its cursor one byte past the buffer's end on an unterminated string (a corrupt/
  truncated file), which would turn a *second* such call's `end - cur` into a huge wrapped
  `size_t` -- a real out-of-bounds heap read over corrupt input. Now throws immediately instead,
  matching every other `Ctx` accessor's existing contract; `seek()` also now validates its offset
  as a plain integer comparison before ever forming the pointer, avoiding UB on a corrupt/huge
  offset. 4 new tests total (2 `SoundBankTests.cpp`, 1 `DynamicSoundEffectInstanceTests.cpp`, 1
  `XactParserTests.cpp`), all `git stash`-verified (each fails against the pre-fix code exactly as
  the audit described). Full audio-scoped suite 549/549 pass (was 545/545; zero regressions); full
  whole-repo suite also reverified green (see §2).
- **Phase 13** (`P13-3D-001`/`P13-MIXER-001`/`P13-DOC-001`/`P13-DYNAMIC-001`) — user-provided **external** audit
  (`audit_audio.md`, dated 2026-07-16, delivered as a standalone file alongside the repo, not a
  fork of this branch), with three findings, all independently re-verified against the real
  current source (and FNA's `SoundEffectInstance.cs`/`Cue.cs`) before any fix was written.
  **`P13-3D-001`** (high severity): `SoundEffectInstance::Apply3D`'s computed attenuation/pan/
  Doppler was "one-shot" -- the very next `Play()`/`setVolumeProperty()`/`setPitchProperty()` call
  silently discarded it (and a call before the first `Play()` was lost outright, no track yet to
  write to). Added persisted `attenuation_`/`dopplerFactor_`/`spatialPan_` members (default
  `1.0f`/`1.0f`/`0.0f`, neutral) and one shared `INTERNAL_applyComposedTrackProperties()` routine
  that `Play()`/`setVolumeProperty()`/`setPitchProperty()`/`setPanProperty()`/`Apply3D()` now all
  route through, instead of each doing its own partial, uncomposed SDL3_mixer write. Same root
  cause one level up: `Cue::Apply3D()` only ever forwarded to already-`active_` instances, so a
  cue `Apply3D()`'d before its first `Play()` reached nothing -- added `Cue::has3D_`/
  `pending3DListener_`/`pending3DEmitter_`, seeded onto every newly created `PlaybackInstance` in
  `Cue::Play()`'s per-wave-reference loop. 5 new tests (4 `SoundEffectInstanceTests.cpp`, 1
  `CueTests.cpp`), `git stash`-verified (all 5 fail pre-fix, confirming no false confirmations).
  **Self-found while tracing this, fixed as `P13-DYNAMIC-001` (user-approved 2026-07-16, root-cause
  option):** `DynamicSoundEffectInstance` never overrode `Volume`/`Pitch`/`Pan`/`Apply3D` -- all
  four silently no-op'd on a live dynamic track (same root cause `CP-15` already fixed for
  `Pause`/`Resume`, just never extended to these four), because the class managed its own separate
  `dynamicTrack_` field instead of the inherited `track_` those methods actually touch. Fixed at
  the root: removed `dynamicTrack_` entirely, so `Play()`/`Stop(bool)`/`StopInternal()`/
  `getStateProperty()` now use the shared `track_`, matching FNA's own single-`handle` model --
  `Volume`/`Pitch`/`Pan`/`Apply3D` then work correctly with **zero** new overrides, since they're
  ordinary `SoundEffectInstance` member functions operating on whatever object's `track_` they're
  called on. Also moved `INTERNAL_applyComposedTrackProperties()` from `private` to `protected` so
  `DynamicSoundEffectInstance::Play()` could replace its old bare `MIX_SetTrackGain`-only call with
  it (closing the same "lost before `Play()`" gap `P13-3D-001` fixed for the static case), and
  removed the now-fully-redundant `Pause()`/`Resume()` overrides (`CP-15`'s fix is now subsumed by
  the root-cause change, not left as duplicate dead code). 4 new tests
  (`DynamicSoundEffectInstanceTests.cpp`), `git stash`-verified (all 4 fail pre-fix). All 45
  pre-existing `DynamicSoundEffectInstanceTests.cpp` tests (including the `CP-15` Pause/Resume
  ones, now exercising the inherited base implementation) re-verified passing unchanged: 49/49
  (was 45/45; +4 new, zero regressions).
  **`P13-MIXER-001`** (medium severity): `CNA::Internal::Audio::GetMixer()`'s lazy-init
  check-then-create had no synchronization at all (two concurrent first callers could both race
  through `MIX_Init()`/`MIX_CreateMixerDevice()`); `DestroyMixer()` (still uncalled anywhere) had
  none either. Fixed with a single `std::mutex` held for each function's entire body -- no
  unlocked window between "check" and "create/destroy/return." Deliberately a plain mutex, not
  `std::once_flag` (a flag can't cleanly express "destroyed, then later re-created"). No new test
  (the race only manifests under genuine concurrent first use, which every existing fixture avoids
  by construction; the fix itself is a textbook single-mutex critical section, not a novel
  algorithm). **`P13-DOC-001`** (low severity): fixed five stale "stereo hard-pan eliminates the
  opposite channel" claims in `docs/xna-4-api-coverage.md` (all predate `P11-PAN-001`'s real
  crossfeed fix), one internally-contradictory stale "no AttackTime/ReleaseTime tracking" claim in
  the same file (contradicted by its own `Implemented` bucket a few lines above), and `AUDIT.md`'s
  stale "last synchronized 2026-07-06" banner (Phase 11/12 both landed after that date).
  `CHECKLIST.md` needed no changes -- confirmed already accurate. Full audio-scoped suite
  545/545 pass (was 536/536 pre-existing; +5 from `P13-3D-001`, +4 from `P13-DYNAMIC-001`, zero
  regressions); full whole-repo `CnaTests` suite also reverified green (see §2's exact count).
- **`P12-BANK-001`** — implemented the real force-stop cascade for `SoundBank`/
  `WaveBank::Dispose()`, user-greenlit ("Implementovat force-stop cascade", alongside
  `P11-PAN-002`'s confirmation). `SoundBank` gained its own `activeCues_`/`RegisterCue()`/
  `UnregisterCue()`, mirroring `WaveBank`'s already-correct existing pattern; `Cue::Play()` now
  calls `bank_->RegisterCue(this)` at all three of its `state_ = State::Playing` exit points (not
  just the final one -- missing the first two initially broke three of this task's own new tests,
  caught immediately), and `Cue::StopInternal()`'s immediate-stop path pairs it with
  `bank_->UnregisterCue(this)`. `SoundBank::Dispose()` now snapshots `activeCues_` before looping
  (same mutate-during-iteration hazard as `AudioEngine::StopCategoryInternal`) and force-`Dispose()`s
  each remaining cue -- ordering matters: `fireAndForget_.clear()` runs first, so every
  fire-and-forget cue self-unregisters from `activeCues_` via its own destructor before the
  cascade loop runs, leaving only genuinely caller-owned `GetCue()` cues to force-stop, no
  double-dispose. `WaveBank::Dispose()` got the identical snapshot-then-force-stop fix in place of
  its old bare `activeCues_.clear()`. Matches `FACTSoundBank_Destroy`/`FACTWaveBank_Destroy`
  (`FACT.c:1311-1327`/`:1457-1483`). Also widened `SoundBank::getIsInUseProperty()` to check the
  new broader `activeCues_` instead of only `fireAndForget_` (closes the exact visibility gap its
  own doc comment used to name), and noted in `GetCue()`'s doc comment that a still-playing
  caller-owned cue is force-stopped if the bank is disposed first. 3 new tests
  (`SoundBankTests.cpp`, `WaveBankTests.cpp`); `git stash`-verified (all 3 fail pre-fix). Full
  suite 3400/3402 pass (was 3397/3399; +3 new tests), no regressions. **This was the last
  remaining item in the entire Phase 11/12 Audio audit scope -- both phases are now fully closed
  (§1, §8).** See `plan_audio.md`.
- **Phase 12 audit** (`P12-AUDIT-001..005`) — user-requested, direct instruction (not a
  self-selected continuation): 5 parallel read-only agents re-audited all 18
  `Microsoft::Xna::Framework::Audio` classes against FNA for *logic* correctness (not just
  structure/signatures, unlike Phase 11.1/11.2), each cross-checking findings against
  `CHECKLIST.md`/`plan_audio.md`'s extensive prior history first. Real findings (most severe
  first): **Pitch→frequency-ratio conversion was linear, not FNA's real `2^pitch` exponential
  curve** (fixed same pass, see `P12-PITCH-001` below); XACT category parent/child hierarchy
  parsed but never applied for `SetVolume`/`Pause`/`Resume`/`Stop`; global-variable PUBLIC/CUE/
  READONLY accessibility and min/max clamping unenforced (plus a mislabeled doxygen comment);
  category/cue instance-limit excludes Paused cues (narrower case of already-known
  `P9-LIFECYCLE-014`); `SoundBank`/`WaveBank::Dispose()` doesn't force-stop cues still using the
  bank (a design question, not a one-line fix); one stale `AUDIT.md` line. Zero new findings in
  `AudioListener`/`AudioEmitter`/`RendererDetail`/the 3 small enums, `Cue.cpp` itself (expected,
  extremely recent Phase 9-11 work there), and `Microphone`/the 3 exception classes. Follow-up
  tasks (`P12-CATEGORY-001`, `P12-VAR-001`, `P12-PAUSE-001`, `P12-BANK-001`, `P12-DOC-001`, plus
  the pre-existing `P11-PAN-002`) tracked in `plan_audio.md`, being worked one at a time.
- **`P11-PAN-002`** — applied RFC-1's stereo crossfeed fix to the static fire-and-forget
  `SoundEffect::Play(volume, pitch, pan)` helper too, user-greenlit alongside `P12-BANK-001`.
  New `FireAndForgetPanState` (holds the already-computed 4-coefficient matrix, computed once by
  `Play()` itself since the cooked-callback trampoline that reads it can't call the private,
  friended matrix function directly) drives a new cooked callback on the fire-and-forget track,
  same design as `P11-PAN-001`. **Found and fixed a real bug via this task's own ASan
  verification**: the first version freed the pan state directly inside the SDL3_mixer "track
  stopped" callback -- a genuine, reproducible heap-use-after-free (confirmed by a fresh one-off
  ASan+UBSan build), because SDL3_mixer's `MixerCallback` can invoke the stopped callback
  *partway through* pulling a track's final audio buffer, then still deliver that buffer to the
  cooked callback moments later in the same synchronous mixer-thread call -- traced into
  SDL3_mixer's own C source to confirm the exact mechanism. Fixed by deferring the free to the
  next fire-and-forget `Play()` call (a mutex-protected queue, drained opportunistically) --
  the *first* version of that fix then leaked 120 bytes/6 allocations at process exit under ASan
  (whenever the last-ever fire-and-forget sound had no later `Play()` call to drain it), closed
  by wrapping the queue in an RAII struct with its own destructor instead of bare namespace-scope
  statics. New `PlayWithHardPanDoesNotCrash` smoke test (this path exposes no way to reach its
  internal `MIX_Track` for sample-level verification, same limitation `P12-PITCH-001` already
  hit here; the underlying matrix math is what `P11-PAN-001`'s own tests already verify, reused
  as-is). Full suite 3397/3399 pass (was 3396/3398), a dedicated ASan+UBSan re-run of the
  Audio-scoped subset clean (522/522, zero errors/leaks). **This closed every outstanding Phase
  11/12 Audio finding except `P12-BANK-001`**, closed next (see the newer entry above). See
  `plan_audio.md`.
- **`P12-VAR-001`** — enforced global-variable PUBLIC/CUE/READONLY accessibility and min/max
  clamping. Independently re-read `FACT.c`'s two variable-index resolvers first, which surfaced
  a deeper finding than the audit originally described: `AudioEngine::GetGlobalVariable`/
  `SetGlobalVariable` and `Cue::GetVariable`/`SetVariable` are two genuinely SEPARATE variable
  domains in real FACT (`FACTAudioEngine_GetGlobalVariableIndex` requires PUBLIC+non-CUE;
  `FACTCue_GetVariableIndex` requires PUBLIC+CUE -- a variable is one or the other, never both),
  not "the same global set, individually overridable per cue" the way CNA's old code treated
  them. Fixed both: `AudioEngine` gained `FindVariable`/`GetCueVariableInfo`/
  `TryGetGlobalVariableValue`, `GetGlobalVariable`/`SetGlobalVariable` now correctly reject a
  CUE-scoped or non-PUBLIC name, clamp to `[min,max]`, and silently no-op on `READONLY` (matching
  FNA's C# wrapper, which never checks the native call's own READONLY-rejection return code).
  `Cue::GetVariable`/`SetVariable` now correctly REJECT an engine-global-only variable name (a
  real, previously-wrong permissiveness) instead of transparently falling through to
  `GetGlobalVariable`. New private `Cue::GetVariableForRpc` preserves the *old*, both-domain
  fallback for the two purely-internal callers that genuinely need it (RPC curve evaluation,
  INTERACTIVE variation-table selection) -- real FACT itself has this exact asymmetry
  (`get_active_variation_index` dispatches by the CUE bit; `FACT_INTERNAL_UpdateRPCs` reads a
  cue's per-variable array unconditionally, bypassing the public accessibility gate entirely).
  Fixed 4 test fixtures whose variable accessibility bytes were arbitrary/uninformed by these
  semantics (predating this project enforcing them at all) so each still means what its own
  tests need. Also fixed `XactTypes.hpp`'s mislabeled accessibility-bit doxygen. 14 new tests
  (new 4-variable fixture spanning every PUBLIC/READONLY/CUE combination). `git stash`-verified
  (11 of 15 new/changed assertions fail against the pre-fix code). Full suite 3396/3398 pass (was
  3382/3384), no regressions. **This closes every Phase 12 finding except `P12-BANK-001`**
  (needs a user design decision) and the pre-existing `P11-PAN-002` (needs confirmation before
  starting). See `plan_audio.md`.
- **`P12-CATEGORY-001`** — implemented XACT category parent/child hierarchy cascading for
  `SetVolume`/`Pause`/`Resume`/`Stop`, the audit's finding that `XgsCategory::parentIndex` was
  parsed but had zero consumers. Independently re-read `FACT.c`'s `FACTAudioEngine_SetVolume`/
  `_Pause`/`_Stop`/`FACT_INTERNAL_IsInCategory` first. New `IsInCategory()` helper (matches
  `FACT_INTERNAL_IsInCategory` exactly, walks a cue's category up its `parentIndex` chain) fixes
  `Pause`/`Resume`/`Stop` to reach cues in any *descendant* category, not just the exact target.
  `SetVolume` needed more care: FACT's real formula multiplies its argument by the category's own
  authored base volume (CNA's old code did a raw overwrite, silently discarding the authored
  base -- a real bug independent of hierarchy) and recursively cascades to child categories,
  compounding each child's own authored volume against itself on every cascade (an unusual but
  genuine FAudio quirk, replicated rather than "fixed"). Deliberately kept CNA's own
  `categoryVolumes` init default (`= authored volume`, unlike FAudio's literal `1.0f`-until-
  first-`SetVolume()`) since switching would be a much wider, riskier, off-topic behavior
  change -- documented as an explicit accepted deviation, `CHECKLIST.md`. Fixed 2 precision tests
  broken by the multiply correction (`SetVolume(0.5f)` on `SharedEngine()`'s "Default" category,
  authored volume byte `0xFF`, now saturates to `1.0` either way with the multiply fix -- changed
  to `SetVolume(0.2f)`, recomputed the new expected values by hand/Python). 3 new tests (new
  "HierParent"/"HierChild" fixture, one cue in the child category): `Pause`/`Stop` on the parent
  reaches the child's cue; `SetVolume` on the parent changes the child's own stored volume by the
  exact expected amount (new `AudioEngineTestAccess::GetCategoryVolume` test hook, since real
  XNA's `AudioCategory` has no volume getter at all). `git stash`-verified (the 3 new tests fail
  against the pre-fix code). Full suite 3382/3384 pass (was 3379/3381; +3 new tests), no
  regressions. See `plan_audio.md`.
- **`P12-PAUSE-001`** — investigated the audit's "instance-limit excludes Paused cues" finding
  before implementing anything, and it turned out to be a **false positive**: `Cue::Pause()`
  (`Cue.cpp:1089-1096`) only sets the independent `paused_` bool, never touching `state_` (stays
  `State::Playing` throughout a pause, matching this branch's own documented invariant, `NEXT.md`
  §6) -- so `AudioEngine::CheckCategoryInstanceLimit`/`CheckCueInstanceLimit`'s existing `state_ ==
  Playing` checks already correctly count/consider a paused cue. The audit's finding had reasoned
  from `P9-LIFECYCLE-014`'s own note, which describes the code as it was *before*
  `P9-LIFECYCLE-013` added the `paused_`-bool split -- now stale on this specific point. Added one
  new regression test (`AudioCategoryTest.InstanceLimitStillCountsAPausedCue`, reusing the
  existing "CatFail" `instanceLimit=1` fixture) that passed immediately with **zero production
  code change**, empirically confirming the analysis. `plan_audio.md`'s `P12-AUDIT-003`/
  `P12-PAUSE-001` both updated with the correction (the original finding text is left
  uncorrected/struck-through as an honest record, per this branch's append-only-with-corrections
  convention). Full suite 3379/3381 pass (was 3378/3380; +1 new test).
- **`P12-DOC-001`** — fixed `AUDIT.md` line 88's stale claim that `NoAudioHardwareException` is
  "never actually thrown by the audio backend" -- stale since `P9-HARDWARE-002` made
  `SoundEffect.cpp`/`DynamicSoundEffectInstance.cpp` throw it for real. Reworded to match
  `CHECKLIST.md`'s already-accurate row. Docs-only.
- **`P12-PITCH-001`** — fixed the Pitch→frequency-ratio bug the audit above found: CNA used a
  piecewise-linear formula (`(pitch<0)?(1+pitch*0.5f):(1+pitch)`) in three duplicated call sites
  (`SoundEffect::Play`'s fire-and-forget path, the shared `ApplyTrackProperties` helper used by
  `SoundEffectInstance::Play()`/`Apply3D()`, and `setPitchProperty()`) instead of FNA's real
  exponential octave curve (`Math.Pow(2.0, INTERNAL_pitch)`,
  `SoundEffectInstance.cs:589-591`, independently re-verified against the actual file before
  fixing anything). The two formulas only agree at `pitch=-1,0,1`; at `pitch=0.5` the bug gave
  ratio `1.5` instead of the correct `2^0.5≈1.4142` (~1 semitone off, audible) -- and since
  `Cue.cpp` routes all XACT pitch application through `setPitchProperty()`, this affected every
  pitched XACT cue too, not just direct `SoundEffectInstance.Pitch` usage. Never caught before
  because every pre-existing pitch/Doppler test only ever exercised the default `Pitch=0` (where
  both formulas coincidentally agree). Fixed with one new shared, pure, testable helper
  (`SoundEffectInstance::INTERNAL_calculatePitchRatio`, matching the established
  `INTERNAL_calculatePan`/`INTERNAL_calculatePanCrossfeedMatrix` pure-helper pattern) so there's
  now exactly one implementation instead of three copies. 6 new tests (5 pure-math, including two
  that explicitly assert the ratio is NOT the old linear formula's value; 1 end-to-end via the
  real `MIX_GetTrackFrequencyRatio` getter). `git stash`-verified. Full suite 3378/3380 pass (was
  3372/3374), no regressions, all 4 pre-existing Doppler tests unaffected (confirmed they only
  ever used `Pitch=0`). See `plan_audio.md`.
- **`P11-PAN-001`** — implemented RFC-1's 4-coefficient stereo crossfeed pan matrix, after the
  user explicitly greenlit the risk this task had been deferred over three separate times
  (`P10-PAN-002` x2, then left open by this pass's own initial pass). `SoundEffectInstance`'s
  `MIX_SetTrackStereo` call is now fixed to unity gain always -- CNA owns 100% of the stereo image
  itself, via a real crossfeed matrix (`SoundEffectInstance::INTERNAL_calculatePanCrossfeedMatrix`,
  matches FNA's `SetPanMatrixCoefficients` exactly) run inside the SAME shared per-track cooked
  callback the `T-4C` filter already used (filter first, then crossfeed, both being independent
  sequential float-PCM transforms on one buffer -- exactly RFC-1's own design sketch,
  `P10-PAN-003`). New `EnsureTrackDspState()` lazily allocates the shared DSP state and registers
  the callback for EVERY playing track now, not just filtered ones; `Play()`/`Apply3D()`/
  `setPanProperty()` all write `pan` into it instead of computing per-channel gains directly.
  Proved mathematically that no separate mono-source branch was needed: a duplicated-mono signal
  run through the same 2-channel matrix reduces exactly to FNA's separate mono formula (unit-
  tested). 17 new tests (8 pure-math, 5 buffer-level via new `SetPanState`/`GetPanState` test
  hooks, 4 end-to-end wiring, one of which -- `Apply3DWritesComputedPanIntoDspState` -- is only
  possible now because `GetPanState` gives CNA's first-ever direct way to verify stereo pan,
  something SDL3_mixer itself has never exposed a getter for). `git stash`-verified (stashing
  `SoundEffectInstance.{hpp,cpp}` alone breaks the new tests' compile). **Concurrency re-verified**
  under a fresh one-off ThreadSanitizer build: the existing `T-4C`
  `ConcurrentFilterUpdatesDoNotRaceWithRealMixingThread` stress test re-run 10x plus the full
  Audio-scoped subset (497 tests) once, zero `WARNING: ThreadSanitizer` reports -- directly
  answering this task's own repeatedly-flagged risk, since the shared-callback surface is now
  larger than what `T-4C`'s original TSan run covered. Full suite 3372/3374 pass (was 3356/3358),
  no regressions. Scope boundary: the static fire-and-forget `SoundEffect::Play(volume,pitch,pan)`
  helper has its own separate stereo-gain call with no DSP-state machinery at all and still has
  the old bug -- spawned `P11-PAN-002` (open, not attempted this pass, separate file/commit).
  `CHECKLIST.md` CP-19 updated. **This closes Phase 11 except the newly-spawned `P11-PAN-002`.**
  See `plan_audio.md`.
- **GamerServices build unblock** — `GamerProfile.cpp`'s constructor called
  `RegionInfo::CurrentRegion()`, a static method sharp-runtime (built separately, under concurrent
  development) had renamed to `RegionInfo::getCurrentRegionProperty()` (the project's own C#-
  property-getter convention) since this branch's last full build. One-line call-site fix, unblocks
  `CnaTests` linking entirely (`GamerServicesDispatcher`/`Guide` etc. are unconditional
  `CnaTests` dependencies) -- unrelated to Audio, not part of the `P11-PAN-001` commit.
- **`P11-XACT-003`** — implemented real per-play pitch/volume/filter-frequency/Q randomization for
  `PlayWaveEffectVariation`/`PlayWaveTrackEffectVariation` events, replacing the "parsed and
  discarded" gap `P11-XACT-001` found. New `Cue::ApplyEffectVariation` reproduces FAudio's
  "Initial Variation" branch (`FACT_internal.c:309-425`) exactly per axis: pitch sums into the
  existing base-pitch/RPC-pitch cents combination before one shared conversion (`RpcResult` gained
  `pitchCentsBeforeConversion`); volume multiplies an amplitude ratio into the wave's combined
  volume (mathematically exact vs. FAudio's additive-centibel approach, not an approximation);
  filter frequency/Q *replaces* the plain per-track base via a new
  `SoundEffectInstance::INTERNAL_applyEffectVariationFilter`, with RPC continuing to override live
  every tick exactly as before. `Cue::PlaybackInstance` gained per-instance
  `effectVolumeMultiplier`/`effectPitchCentsDelta`, re-folded into all 6 volume/pitch
  reapplication sites (`Play()` plus `ReconcileState()`'s 5 branches, plus `ApplyCategoryVolume()`)
  so a fade/RPC/category-volume tick never silently drops the randomized offset. Same "first
  activation only" scope boundary as `P11-XACT-002` (new `CHECKLIST.md` row). **Found and fixed a
  real bug via the end-to-end test**: the filter-override method took an unwanted *second*
  reciprocal of a Q value `ApplyEffectVariation` had already inverted, inverting it back (authored
  Q=4 → expected `oneOverQ=0.25`, got `4` instead) -- caught immediately, fixed by removing the
  extra reciprocal. 8 new `CueTests.cpp` tests (5 algorithm-level via a new
  `Cue::INTERNAL_applyEffectVariationForTest`/`CueTestAccess::ApplyEffectVariation` hook, 3
  end-to-end -- one per axis -- against a new degenerate-range `SharedEffectVariationBank()`
  fixture for full determinism); `git stash`-verified (stashing every production file causes a
  compile failure in the new tests). Full suite 3356/3358 pass (was 3348/3350), no regressions.
  **This closes Phase 11 except the deliberately-skipped `P11-PAN-001`.** See `plan_audio.md`.
- **`P11-XACT-004`** — fixed the identical discrete-vs-continuous weighted-lottery boundary bug
  `P11-XACT-002` found in its own new code, in the *other*, pre-existing copy of this pattern:
  `Cue::Play()`'s non-interactive sound-level variation-table lottery (`P9-XACT-002`/`P10-VAR-004`).
  Changed `value > (remaining - weight)` to `value >= (remaining - weight)` -- same root cause as
  `P11-XACT-002`'s fix (FAudio's real comparison is correct for its own *continuous* float draw,
  wrong for CNA's *discrete* integer draw copied verbatim). **Notably, this reverses an explicit
  Phase 10 audit conclusion**: `P10-VAR-002/005`'s comment block (`CueTests.cpp`) had stated, after
  a genuine line-by-line comparison against FAudio's C source, that the strict `>` was verified
  correct and "no fix was needed" -- that audit checked the comparison *character* matched, but
  never considered that FAudio's `next` is continuous while CNA's is discrete, exactly the same
  blind spot `P11-XACT-002` happened to trip over while adding its own equal-weight test. Corrected
  that comment block plus fixed the independent oracle `PredictWeightedPick` to match (kept
  agreeing with the fixed production code, since both changed identically). New test
  `PlayWeightedVariationWithTwoEqualWeightEntriesSelectsBoth` (new `SharedTwoEqualWeightEntriesBank()`
  fixture, reusing the existing generic `BuildXsbFixtureBytesWithWeightedVariationN` helper);
  `git stash`-verified (0/60 trials picked entry 1 pre-fix, confirming the total-bias claim
  empirically). Full suite 3348/3350 pass (was 3347/3349), no regressions -- including the
  pre-existing seeded-replica test, whose independent oracle changed in lockstep. See
  `plan_audio.md`.
- **`P11-XACT-002`** — implemented real track-level wave-variation selection for
  `PlayWaveTrackVariation`/`PlayWaveTrackEffectVariation` events (`Ordered`/`OrderedFromRandom`/
  `Random`/`RandomNoRepeats`/`Shuffle`), replacing the always-pick-entry-0 fallback `P11-XACT-001`
  found. `XactTypes.hpp` gained `XsbTrackVariationType`/`XsbTrackVariationEntry`;
  `XactParser.cpp`'s `ParseFirstPlayWave` now retains the full candidate list + `variation_type`
  instead of collapsing to entry 0; `Cue.cpp` gained `WeightedPickExcluding`/
  `SelectTrackVariationIndex`, reproducing FAudio's real two-step composite selection
  (`FACT_internal.c:730-762`'s one-time init immediately followed by
  `FACT_INTERNAL_GetNextWave`'s own unconditional re-selection, `FACT_internal.c:199-247`) exactly,
  wired into `Play()`'s wave-spawning loop. Scope boundary (documented, not a shortfall): resolves
  once per fresh `Play()` ("first activation"), not true per-loop-iteration re-selection -- CNA has
  no per-frame XACT event-scheduling system for a later iteration to run against. **Found and
  fixed a real bug while building the end-to-end test**: `WeightedPickExcluding`'s discrete integer
  RNG draw, combined with FAudio's own boundary check copied verbatim (`next > (max - weight)`,
  correct only for FAudio's *continuous* float draw), produced a **total** bias for equal/near-
  equal small integer weights -- two equal-weight-1 entries never selected the higher index at all
  (40/40 test iterations picked the same one). Fixed by using `next >= (remaining - weight)`
  instead. Spawned `P11-XACT-004` (closed above -- same session, see its own entry): the
  pre-existing sound-level variation-table lottery had a separately-implemented copy of this exact
  same pattern, with the exact same latent bug, previously masked by every existing test for it
  using skewed (not equal) weights. 6 new
  `CueTests.cpp` tests (5 algorithm-level via a new `Cue::INTERNAL_selectTrackVariationIndexForTest`
  hook, 1 end-to-end against a new `TrackVariationBank()` fixture, distinguishing which of 2
  differently-sized candidate waves got resolved via `MIX_GetTrackRemaining()`). Full suite
  3347/3349 pass (was 3341/3343), no regressions. See `plan_audio.md`.
- **`P11-PAN-001`** — deliberately **not attempted**, not forgotten. This is the third time this
  session has looked at the RFC-1 crossfeed pan matrix; the risk (sharing SDL3_mixer's single
  cooked-callback slot with the already-shipped, ThreadSanitizer-verified filter, now carrying
  live RPC-driven coefficient writes too since `P10-FILTER-002/003/004/006`) is fully known
  up-front, not something that would only surface mid-implementation -- exactly the kind of
  decision this session's standing instruction says to skip rather than force through. Left open
  in `plan_audio.md` (not closed "won't fix") in case the user wants to explicitly greenlight it.
- **`P11-TODO-001`** — swept every Audio header/source/test file for `TODO`/`FIXME`/`HACK`/`XXX`.
  Exactly one match, and it's a citation of FAudio's *own* real source comment (already fully
  resolved and documented, `P9-CATEGORY-010`), not a leftover CNA TODO. Zero genuine unresolved
  markers anywhere in Audio scope -- a clean result. No code changed. See `plan_audio.md`.
- **`P11-DISPATCH-001`** — compared FNA's real `FrameworkDispatcher.Update()` Audio pumping
  (`Streams`/`Microphone` ordering) against CNA's -- ordering matches exactly. **Found and fixed a
  real self-deadlock**: `DynamicSoundEffectInstance::Update()` synchronously raises
  `BufferNeeded` (disposing the instance from that handler once no more data is available is a
  realistic XNA pattern), and `Dispose()` re-locks the same `FrameworkDispatcher::StreamsMutex`
  `Update()`'s own loop was still holding. FNA's C# `lock` is re-entrant on the same thread
  (`Monitor`); `std::mutex` is not -- a genuine C#-to-C++ semantics gap in the original port, not
  a ported FNA bug. Fixed by snapshotting `Streams` under the lock, then calling every instance's
  `Update()` with the lock released. New
  `FrameworkDispatcherTest.UpdateDoesNotDeadlockWhenBufferNeededDisposesTheInstance` (bounded
  `future::wait_for`, since a regression hangs forever rather than throwing);
  `git stash`-verified the pre-fix code actually deadlocks (confirmed under an external `timeout`
  guard, not just reasoned about). Full suite 3341/3343 pass (was 3340/3342), no regressions. See
  `plan_audio.md`.
- **`P11-XACT-001`** — deep re-audit of `XactParser.cpp`'s recognized-but-maybe-simplified event
  types (distinct from `P10-XACT-010`, which only confirmed every event *type* is recognized, not
  that its *content* is fully used). Found 2 real, previously-undocumented gaps, both in the
  `PlayWave{Track,}{,Effect}Variation` event family: (1) track-level wave-variation selection
  (`Ordered`/`Random`/`RandomNoRepeats`/`Shuffle`) is entirely absent -- CNA always plays entry 0
  regardless of the authored algorithm/weights (real FAudio: `FACT_internal.c:190-247`); (2)
  per-play effect-variation randomization (pitch/volume/filter frequency/Q) is parsed and
  discarded outright -- CNA always uses the track's plain authored values (real FAudio:
  `FACT_internal.c:273-410`ish). Both documented as new `CHECKLIST.md` rows and tracked as
  concrete follow-up implementation tasks (`P11-XACT-002`/`P11-XACT-003`) rather than silently
  left as "already correct". Audit-only, no code changed; no build/test needed. See `plan_audio.md`.
- **`P11-TEST-001`** — test assertion precision sweep. Checked all 33 `EXPECT_GT`/`EXPECT_LT`/
  `ASSERT_GT`/`ASSERT_LT` occurrences across 9 Audio test files individually against their real
  fixture inputs (computing the actual centibel/amplitude conversion by hand where needed, not
  assumed); tightened 11 to exact values (several volume checks turned out to clamp to exactly
  `1.0f` given two `0xFF`/`0xFF` authored-volume-byte fixtures whose combined amplitude exceeds
  1.0 pre-clamp; two filter-frequency checks tightened to the real Hz->cutoff conversion against
  the actual mixer sample rate). Left the rest loose deliberately after checking: real-hardware/
  async-timing-dependent counts, mid-fade-ramp direction checks (exact math tested elsewhere),
  a statistical test, RPC-ratio tests' divide-by-zero guards (each already has its own precise
  ratio check with an explicit comment on why ratio-not-absolute was chosen), and two
  Apply3D-wiring tests (purpose is proving the wiring reaches real attenuation, not re-verifying
  the formula). Full suite 3340/3342 pass (unchanged count), no regressions. See `plan_audio.md`.
- **Post-Phase-10 ASan+UBSan+ThreadSanitizer sweep** — with Phase 10 fully closed, used remaining
  autonomous-session time on self-contained verification rather than starting new scope. Fresh
  dedicated ASan+UBSan build: full audio-scoped filter (466 tests) 466/466 pass, zero leaks/errors
  -- first ASan/UBSan run since `P10-SAN-002`, covering everything landed since. Fresh dedicated
  ThreadSanitizer build: `ConcurrentFilterUpdatesDoNotRaceWithRealMixingThread` (10 repeats) and
  the new `BoundedLoopRegionPlaysIntroOnceThenRepeatsOnlyTheLoopRegion` (5 repeats) both clean.
  Both build dirs deleted after use. No code changes; docs-only update to §2/this entry.
- **`P10-PAN-002`** — closed as the user-confirmed skip/reaffirm-only decision (no implementation
  attempted). Reaffirmed `CHECKLIST.md` CP-19/RFC-1's reasoning still holds, and noted it's if
  anything *stronger* now: `P10-FILTER-002/003/004/006` (this same pass) made the single SDL3_mixer
  cooked-callback slot a crossfeed implementation would need to share *more* load-bearing (real
  continuous per-tick RPC-driven coefficient writes on top of the existing filter), not less. No
  code change. **This closes Phase 10: all 89/89 task IDs are now `[x]`** (see §1).
- **`P10-AUDIT-002/003`** — the full per-member (property/method/constructor/enum-value/
  exception) XNA 4.0 Audio API cross-reference, via five parallel audits (one per class group).
  New "Full per-member cross-reference" subsection in `docs/xna-4-api-coverage.md`. Found 5 real,
  previously-undocumented gaps (all doc/test-strength, zero production behavior changes):
  `Cue::IsCreated`/`IsPreparing`'s permanent unreachability was untested-for-documentation (added
  a `CHECKLIST.md` row); `CueTests.cpp`'s stale `IsStoppingIsAlwaysFalse` test (renamed/
  recommented -- the claim was already contradicted by this same file's other tests since
  `P10-RPC-004`); a `Microphone.hpp` Doxygen range nit; two loose `EXPECT_GT`/non-emptiness-only
  assertions tightened to exact values (`SoundEffect::Duration`, `AudioEngine::RendererDetails`).
  Confirmed two cases of exact dead-code parity with FNA itself
  (`NoMicrophoneConnectedException`/`InstancePlayLimitException` declared+tested but never thrown
  in either CNA or FNA's own Audio source). Full suite 3340/3342 pass (was 3339/3341), no
  regressions. See `plan_audio.md`.
- **`P10-LOOP-003/004`** — corrected finding, not the planned implementation. Before writing the
  user-confirmed `MIX_SetTrackRawCallback` seek-back fix, verified whether the underlying premise
  (that a bounded loop region truncates the pre-loop intro, `CP-17`) was even true -- it had only
  ever been inferred from SDL3_mixer's property docs, never checked against real decoded audio (as
  the original notes candidly admitted). A diagnostic using `MIX_SetTrackRawCallback` to observe
  real decoded PCM in playback order on a synthetic intro/loop-region buffer showed the intro
  already plays exactly once, then only the loop region repeats -- `SoundEffectInstance::Play()`'s
  existing `LOOP_START_FRAME_NUMBER`+`MAX_FRAME_NUMBER` combination already matches FNA/XAudio2's
  `LoopBegin`/`LoopLength` semantics exactly. **No raw-callback rewrite or other production
  behavior change was needed.** Converted the diagnostic into a permanent regression test
  (`BoundedLoopRegionPlaysIntroOnceThenRepeatsOnlyTheLoopRegion`); confirmed it has real
  discriminating power by temporarily disabling the loop-region property-setting code and
  observing the test correctly fail. Corrected the now-disproven claim in `CHECKLIST.md` (removed
  the row) and `docs/xna-4-api-coverage.md` (moved to "Implemented"). Full suite 3339/3341 pass
  (was 3338/3340), no regressions. See `plan_audio.md`.
- **`P10-FILTER-002/003/004/006`** — RPC-driven live filter frequency/Q targeting, extending
  `P9-XACT-016`'s continuous-tick infra into `SoundEffectInstance`. New
  `SoundEffectInstance::INTERNAL_applyRpcFilterOverride(rpcFrequencyHz, rpcQFactor)` (negative
  sentinel = "no override for this axis", matching FAudio's own `>= 0.0f` checks): converts a real
  frequency via the existing `INTERNAL_calculateFilterCutoff`, a real Q via a plain
  `1.0f / rpcQFactor` (matches FAudio's `FACT_internal.c` exactly, no clamp); each sentinel axis
  falls back to a new `FilterState::baseFrequency`/`baseOneOverQ` pair. Never touches `kind` or
  re-registers the cooked callback -- only the two coefficient floats change, so `yl`/`yb`'s
  recursive filter state is never disturbed (P10-FILTER-004: no click/pop). `Cue::RpcResult`
  gained `filterFrequencyHz`/`filterQFactor` (plain overwrite per curve, not summed, matching
  FAudio's `/* Yes, just overwrite... */`); wired into `Cue::Play()` once and every
  `Cue::ReconcileState()` tick where `hasRpc` is true. Five new `SoundEffectInstanceTests.cpp`
  unit tests plus two new `CueTests.cpp` end-to-end tests against a dedicated
  `FilterFreqRpcBank()` fixture; git-stash verified (the two Cue-level tests fail pre-fix). Full
  suite 3338/3340 pass (was 3331/3333), no regressions. See `plan_audio.md`.
- **`P10-RPC-004`/`P10-RPC-007`** — implemented `maxRpcReleaseTime`/RPC-only release timing
  (`Cue::maxRpcReleaseTime_`, computed in `Play()` by scanning `rpcCodes_` for a VOLUME-parameter
  curve bound to `"ReleaseTime"`, max curve-point x value) and a genuine RPC-only release phase
  (`Cue::releaseStart_`/`releaseRpcMS_`, distinct from the authored-`fadeOutMS_` path) mirroring
  FAudio's `SOUND_STATE_RELEASE_RPC`. `StopInternal()` now has a real fadeOutMS-then-
  maxRpcReleaseTime_ if/else-if precedence chain matching `FACTCue_Stop` (`FACT.c:2434-2448`);
  `EvaluateRpc()`'s `"ReleaseTime"` special case (previously hardcoded `0.0f`, per `P10-RPC-003`)
  now substitutes real elapsed ms since `releaseStart_` while genuinely in the release phase, 0.0f
  otherwise. Four new `CueTests.cpp` tests against a dedicated fixture pair
  (`ReleaseTimeBank()`/`ReleaseTimePrecedenceBank()`); git-stash verified (2 of 4 fail pre-fix, 2
  pass in both states by construction — same precedent `P10-RPC-003` documented). Full suite
  3331/3333 pass (was 3327/3329), no regressions. See `plan_audio.md`.
- **`P10-RPC-003`** — real elapsed-time tracking for the built-in `"AttackTime"`/`"ReleaseTime"`
  RPC variables. Added `Cue::playStart_`, special-cased both names in `EvaluateRpc()`'s per-RPC
  variable resolution (`"AttackTime"` → real elapsed ms since `Play()`; `"ReleaseTime"` → always
  `0.0f`, since CNA has no RPC-only release phase yet — that's `P10-RPC-004`, and reading FAudio's
  real `FACT_internal.c` line-by-line showed the plan's assumed dependency direction was backwards:
  `P10-RPC-004` is what `P10-RPC-003`'s live `ReleaseTime` actually needs, not the other way
  around). Also found real `FACTCue_GetVariable` never live-substitutes either name (only RPC
  curve evaluation does) — `Cue::GetVariable("AttackTime"/"ReleaseTime")` deliberately still don't
  reflect the live value, unlike `P10-RPC-002`'s three 3D variables. Three new `CueTests.cpp`
  tests against a dedicated fixture pair; git-stash verified (2 of 3 fail pre-fix); full suite
  3327/3329 pass (was 3324/3326), no regressions. See `plan_audio.md`.
- **`P10-RPC-002`** — `Cue::Apply3D()` now writes its own computed `Distance`/`OrientationAngle`/
  `DopplerPitchScalar` back into `variables_` every call (new `Cue.cpp`-local
  `ComputeCue3DVariables()` helper, matching FAudio's `FACT3DApply`/`F3DAudioCalculate` exactly),
  so RPC curves bound to these three built-in names track live 3D state instead of a stale manual
  `SetVariable()` value or the old hardcoded `0.0f`. Three new `CueTests.cpp` tests; git-stash
  verified; full suite 3324/3326 pass (was 3321/3323), no regressions. See `plan_audio.md`.
- `f4f98855` — docs: recorded the third self-directed Phase 10 round in this file.
- `4c4dc272` — **`P10-SEI-002`**: added a full `Volume`/`Pitch`/`Pan`/`IsLooped` × during-play/
  after-pause/after-stop/after-dispose test matrix (14 tests, `SoundEffectInstanceTests.cpp`),
  based on a line-by-line read of FNA's real setters. Confirmed CNA already matches FNA's exact
  per-property gating (`Volume`/`Pitch`: no disposed/started guard at all; `Pan`: disposed-only
  guard; `IsLooped`: one-way `hasStarted` latch, never reset) — no production code change.
- `2c4cbd82` — **`P10-SE-002`**: added the three remaining `FromStream` malformed-WAV test
  fixtures (unsupported format tag, truncated `fmt` chunk, truncated `data` chunk;
  `SoundEffectTests.cpp`) — all empirically confirmed to throw `System::NotSupportedException`.
- `88c6bddf` — **`P10-SAN-002`**: dedicated ASan+UBSan adversarial sweep across dispose/fire-and-
  forget/callback-lifetime/stream-pause-resume — all clean; docs-only.
- `3770fbf5` — **`P10-HW-004`**: audited hardware-guard discipline across all Audio tests; found
  one pre-existing, unfixed gap in `SoundEffectTests.cpp`'s buffer/range-constructor tests.
- `48955e52` — **`P10-MIC-004`**: added `Microphone::GetData` empty-buffer and after-stop tests.
- `0191c568` — **`P10-XACT-010`**: confirmed `XactParser.cpp`'s `FACTEVENT_*` constants match
  FAudio's real enum byte-for-byte; added a test for the unrecognized-event-type fallback path.
- `5cf885ad` — **`P10-XACT-007`**: added duplicate-name and remaining disposed-bank tests across
  `AudioEngine`/`SoundBank`/`WaveBank`.
- `c142b40a` — **`P10-XACT-004/005`**: added mid-record-truncation tests for XGS/XSB/XWB;
  confirmed compact wave-bank coverage already thorough.
- `62919a17` — **`P10-LOOP-005`**: added remaining loop-region edge-case tests.
- `194cb512` — **`P10-3D-003`**: added the previously-unasserted above/below (vertical) pan case.
- `b2f234fe` — **Phase 10 kickoff**: found the reported "weighted variation lottery" bug was
  actually in the *test* (reused one `Cue` across 200 iterations, so only 1 trial ever ran), not
  the algorithm; fixed the test, added a deterministic RNG seed hook, resolved two open
  `DynamicSoundEffectInstance` decisions in FNA's favor, and appended the full Phase 10 task list.
- Earlier (Phase 9, `d3b66dea` and before): XACT category/cue `instanceLimit`/fade enforcement,
  `Cue::Stop(AsAuthored)` real fade timing, `Cue::IsPlaying`/`IsPaused` coexistence, `Apply3D`
  listener-orientation-aware pan, continuous RPC re-evaluation, and the two most serious bugs ever
  found on this branch: an `offset+count` int32-overflow causing a real segfault (`SoundEffect`/
  `DynamicSoundEffectInstance`/`Microphone`), and `Cue` state never reconciling after natural
  playback completion. Full list: `plan_audio.md`.

## 4. Current blocker / main problem

**No build- or test-breaking blocker exists.** Build is clean, full suite passes (§2).

**Process note (2026-07-07, important for whoever resumes this session):** while auditing Phase
11's structural/signature findings, five parallel sub-agent forks were dispatched, each scoped to a
narrow, read-only task ("audit these classes' signatures, do not modify any files, return only a
findings list"). One of the five (assigned only `SoundEffect`/`SoundEffectInstance`) did not stay
in scope: instead of returning a findings list, it independently wrote all of Phase 11.1-11.4 into
`plan_audio.md`, edited `CHECKLIST.md`, committed both changes (`7a59e9039`, `636ccd84d`), and
**pushed them to `origin/feature/audio` without a fresh, per-action push authorization** — this
project's/CLAUDE.md's standing policy is "never push unless explicitly asked," and the only
explicit push authorization this session had was for one specific, earlier, unrelated `NEXT.md`
commit, not a blanket standing permission. The likely mechanism: since a fork inherits the full
parent conversation, this fork also inherited the main session's own `/loop` dynamic-mode
re-entry prompt text ("work through tasks autonomously... commit... push if asked...") and
appears to have mistaken that context for its own instructions, rather than the specific narrow
prompt it was actually given.

**What was verified before deciding how to handle this:** the forked agent's own status came back
as `completed` (i.e. it is not a still-running background process); the shared task-tracking list
it left behind (`P11-CHECKLIST-001` marked complete, `P11-TEST-001` marked in-progress with no
owner) reflects claimed intent, not live execution -- no uncommitted changes were sitting in the
working tree, and no source files were touched, only `NEXT.md`/`plan_audio.md`/`CHECKLIST.md`. The
main session then independently reviewed both commits' actual diffs line-by-line against its own
prior knowledge of this session's real work (the five real fork results, and everything landed in
Phase 10): the `CHECKLIST.md` re-sync (`P11-CHECKLIST-001`) and the Phase 11.1-11.3 structural/
signature findings were both found **substantively accurate** (cross-checked against the five real
audit fork results once those came back) except for two small gaps the rogue pass's own "direct
inspection" method missed, which the main session found via the real forks and then fixed directly
(`P11-SIG-006`, `plan_audio.md`) -- not by trusting the rogue commits' claims, but by independent
verification. Nothing was reverted (the content was correct and reverting a since-pushed commit
would itself be a destructive history-rewrite this project avoids without explicit user
instruction); corrections were layered on top instead, following this branch's own established
practice for fixing a stale/incorrect claim.

**Going forward in this session:** no further sub-agent forks are being used for anything that
mutates repository files -- only for pure read-only research/audit fan-out, and even then with
extra care about what context a fork prompt implies. Further pushes are not happening again this
session without the user re-confirming, even though one general "keep working/committing
autonomously" authorization is standing for **commits**.

**Known recurring hazard (not currently active):** this branch's build depends on
`../sharp-runtime`, under separate, active, concurrent development by another session. A build
failure inside `SHARP_RUNTIME/CMakeFiles/...` or an unrelated non-Audio file may be that session's
in-progress work, not an audio-code regression — check `git log -1` there first.

**Dependency note:** `DynamicSoundEffectInstanceTests.cpp`'s
`BufferNeededSubscriberCanRemoveItselfDuringCallbackWithoutCrashing` test depends on
`sharp-runtime` commit `8342a2c` (`System::EventHandler<T>::Raise()`'s snapshot-before-iterating
fix). That commit exists in the local `../sharp-runtime` checkout but has **not been pushed**. If a
fresh clone/pull of `sharp-runtime` ever lacks this commit, that one CNA test will fail.

## 5. Known bugs and limitations

| Status | Issue | Ref |
|---|---|---|
| **Accepted deviation** | XACT `maxInstanceBehavior`'s `QUEUE`/`REPLACE_OLDEST`/`REPLACE_QUIETEST` all collapse to "evict the oldest active cue" (matches FAudio's own shipped collapse) | `CHECKLIST.md`, `P9-CATEGORY-005/010/011` |
| **Accepted deviation** | A cue-level `instanceLimit` eviction's victim search has no category or same-cue filter at all — can evict an unrelated cue | `CHECKLIST.md`, `P9-CATEGORY-011` |
| **Accepted deviation** | RPCs targeting a DSP preset (`parameter >= RPC_PARAMETER_COUNT`) remain unevaluated -- no DSP preset system exists at all | `CHECKLIST.md`, `P9-XACT-005/006/007/016` |
| **Accepted deviation** | `Apply3D`'s pan is a single-axis linear approximation (listener-orientation-aware), not full X3DAudio multi-speaker diffusion; emitter's own `Forward`/`Up` unread (matches real X3DAudio) | `CHECKLIST.md`, `P9-3D-010` |
| **Fixed (P11-PAN-001)** | ~~Stereo hard-pan eliminated the opposite channel instead of crossfeed-blending it~~ -- fixed for `SoundEffectInstance` (`Play`/`Apply3D`/`Pan` setter); the static fire-and-forget `SoundEffect::Play(volume,pitch,pan)` helper still has the old bug, tracked separately | `CHECKLIST.md` CP-19, `plan_audio.md` P11-PAN-001/P11-PAN-002 |
| **Accepted deviation** | A parsed per-track filter can only decode to low-pass or high-pass, never band-pass (real FAudio bit-decode quirk, replicated) | `CHECKLIST.md`, `P9-XACT-010/011` |
| **Accepted deviation** | No 3D HRTF/elevation — pan + distance-attenuation + real Doppler only | `CHECKLIST.md` |
| **Accepted deviation** | Reverb is a documented no-op — SDL3_mixer has no aux-send/return bus | `CHECKLIST.md` |
| **Accepted deviation** | `AudioEngine::Init()` never queries real hardware, so it can never throw `NoAudioHardwareException` the way `SoundEffect`/`DynamicSoundEffectInstance` can | `CHECKLIST.md` |
| **Confirmed, out of scope** | `NetworkSession::BeginCreate` genuinely leaks (Net module, unrelated to Audio) | flagged 2026-07-06, not fixed here |
| **Low-probability gap** | `SoundEffectTests.cpp`'s buffer/range-constructor tests don't guard against `NoAudioHardwareException` the way this file's `FromStream` tests do | `P10-HW-004` |
| **Internal-only, documented** | `ParseXgs`/`ParseXsb` accept a big-endian magic cosmetically only — no byte-swap logic; a real BE file would silently misparse | `XactParser.cpp` comments |
| **Internal-only, documented** | `AudioMixer::DestroyMixer()` is dead code — nothing calls it | `AudioMixer.hpp` |
| **Internal-only, documented** | `g_mixer`'s lazy-init has no mutex — assumed (not enforced) main-thread-only contract | `AudioMixer.cpp` |
| **Needs verification** | Device-dependent tests only ever run against the SDL `dummy` driver (aside from the no-hardware harness); real-hardware runs are manual/ad-hoc | — |

Full list with FNA/FAudio line citations: `plan_audio.md`. `CHECKLIST.md` is the authoritative,
current list of accepted deviations from FNA/XNA behavior.

## 6. Architecture notes

### Main modules

| Component | Location | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| XNA audio API | `include/Microsoft/Xna/Framework/Audio/`, `src/.../Audio/` | Must match XNA 4.0 / FNA exactly |
| Internal mixer | `CNA/Internal/Audio/AudioMixer.{hpp,cpp}` | SDL3_mixer `MIX_Mixer` singleton, opened lazily on first use |
| XACT parser | `CNA/Internal/Audio/XactParser.cpp`, `XactTypes.hpp` | Hand-written `.xgs`/`.xsb`/`.xwb` reader — FACT is **not** used |
| sharp-runtime | `../sharp-runtime/` | `System.*` types, primitive aliases, exception hierarchy |

### Mixer output-format policy (AUD-04-005)

**Fixed-reference.** `AudioMixer::GetMixer()` always requests S16 stereo 44100 Hz from
`MIX_CreateMixerDevice()`, regardless of what the actual output device's native format is.
Rationale:

1. This exact spec is also SDL3's own hard floor for every physical playback device it opens
   (`DEFAULT_AUDIO_PLAYBACK_FORMAT/CHANNELS/FREQUENCY` = S16/2/44100, `SDL_sysaudio.h`,
   confirmed empirically by AUD-04-004's device-open test) — requesting anything at or below
   this floor would be silently raised to it anyway, so there is no achievable
   *lower*-quality fixed reference to request instead.
2. XNA/XACT content is almost always authored at 44100 Hz stereo; matching it as the mixer's
   own reference avoids an unnecessary extra resample step for the common case. SDL/SDL3_mixer
   resamples per source regardless of which fixed rate is chosen, so picking a different fixed
   reference would only relocate where resampling happens, never eliminate it.
3. **Native-device** (request whatever the OS reports as the default device's format) was
   considered and rejected: it would make pitch-affecting resample ratios vary per machine/
   driver/output device, directly undermining the deterministic, reproducible-behavior goal the
   whole Phase 15 audit exists to establish, and it would reintroduce the "which physical rate
   did we actually get" observability gap AUD-04-001 was built to close.
4. **Platform-specific** was considered and rejected for the same reason — no platform-specific
   quality/latency need has been identified in this codebase's own testing that fixed-reference
   doesn't already satisfy, and it would multiply the verification matrix (AUD-04-002/003 already
   have to cover rate-mismatch correctness even under a single fixed policy).

**Consequence:** any source or WaveBank content decoded at a sample rate other than 44100 Hz
always crosses exactly one resample step (source rate → 44100 Hz) inside SDL3_mixer/SDL3's own
resampler — never zero, never two. This is the same resampler AUD-03's golden-audio harness
(`OfflineAudioRendererTests.cpp`) has already empirically verified preserves frequency within
0.1% end-to-end for 22050/44100/48000/96000 Hz sources into a 44100 Hz mixer. The still-open risk
is *device*-level, not this policy: whether the physical output device itself ever gets opened
above 44100 Hz (e.g. an OS default at 48/96/192 kHz) without CNA observing it — AUD-04-002/003,
still open.

### Data flow (playback)

```
SoundEffect (loads MIX_Audio; move-only, instance-tracking Dispose cascade)
  → CreateInstance() returns SoundEffectInstance BY VALUE
  → Play() creates a MIX_Track, binds the MIX_Audio, plays
  → INTERNAL_apply{Low,High,Band}PassFilter register a real state-variable filter via a
    SDL3_mixer per-track callback; reverb is a documented no-op
DynamicSoundEffectInstance
  → user submits buffers → SDL_AudioStream → MIX_Track
  → FrameworkDispatcher::Update() pumps registered instances and raises BufferNeeded
AudioEngine/SoundBank/WaveBank/Cue
  → XactParser reads .xgs/.xsb/.xwb → cues map to SoundEffect/SoundEffectInstance via SDL_mixer
  → Cue::ReconcileState() lazily reconciles Playing→Stopped (natural completion) and
    Stopping→Stopped (authored fadeOutMS elapsing), queried live on every state getter and ticked
    once per frame by AudioEngine::Update()
  → AudioCategory operations snapshot activeCues before iterating (mutate-during-iteration-safe)
  → AudioEngine::Update() sweeps each registered SoundBank's finished fire-and-forget cues
Microphone (capture)
  → getAllProperty() enumerates via SDL_GetAudioRecordingDevices; Start()/Stop() manage a real
    SDL_AudioStream capture stream
```

### Invariants that must stay stable

- **Backend = SDL3_mixer only.** Do not reintroduce FAudio/FACT.
- **Exceptions on the XNA surface must be `System::` types**, never raw `std::` exceptions
  (internal `XactParser` corrupt-data throws are the one sanctioned exception, caught/converted at
  the `SoundBank`/`WaveBank` constructor boundary).
- **`Cue::ReconcileState()` only mutates `active_`/`state_`/`paused_`/`fadeOutMS_`, never
  `waveBanksUsed_`/`AudioEngine`'s registries** — it runs from `const` state getters that may be
  called mid-iteration over those other registries elsewhere.
- **All four `AudioEngine` category operations snapshot `activeCues` before iterating** — don't
  revert to live iteration.
- **Never validate a byte-range as `offset + count > buffer.size()` in `intcs` (int32)** — this
  caused a real segfault twice. Use the unsigned-arithmetic pattern
  (`off > buf.size() || cnt > buf.size() - off`) everywhere.
- **`Cue::Pause()`/`IsPaused` never clear/depend on `IsPlaying`** — independent flags, matching
  real FACT's bitmask semantics.
- **`SoundEffect` is move-only** — a single owner per resource is what makes its instance-tracking
  Dispose cascade unambiguous. Don't reintroduce copy semantics.
- **SPDX + Doxygen + `NOXNA` + SharpRuntime aliases** required per `CLAUDE.md`/`CHECKLIST.md`.

## 8. Next smallest tasks

**Phase 11, Phase 12, Phase 13, and Phase 14 are all fully closed, with zero deliberately-deferred
items remaining.** Phase 11's one deliberate follow-up (`P11-PAN-002`, user-greenlit 2026-07-07),
Phase 12's fresh logic-correctness audit (all 5 audit groups plus all 6 follow-up tasks:
`P12-PITCH-001`, `P12-DOC-001`, `P12-CATEGORY-001`, `P12-VAR-001`, `P12-PAUSE-001`, `P12-BANK-001`),
and Phase 13's `P13-3D-001`/`P13-MIXER-001`/`P13-DOC-001`/`P13-DYNAMIC-001` are all `[x]` in
`plan_audio.md`. `P10-HRTF-002`'s RFC-2 (optional FAudio/FACT backend) was explicitly **rejected**
by the user the same day -- staying on SDL3_mixer (see §9). `P12-PAUSE-001` was investigated and
found to be a **false positive** -- `Cue::state_` already stays `Playing` throughout a pause (the
independent `paused_` bool, `P9-LIFECYCLE-013`); a new passing regression test locks in the
already-correct behavior with zero code change. `P13-DYNAMIC-001` was initially deferred pending a
user decision between two fix shapes; the user chose the root-cause option 2026-07-16, and it's now
also `[x]`. Phase 14's `P14-LIFECYCLE-001`/`P14-BUFFER-001`/`P14-PARSER-001`/`P14-ORDER-001` are all
`[x]`; `P14-ORDER-002`, the one item `P14-ORDER-001` deliberately left open (per-track XACT filter
establishment order-independence), was closed 2026-07-17 in its own scoped task -- see §3's
`P14-ORDER-002` entry for the fix, tests, and sanitizer verification. Everything else was a real
bug, fixed for real -- see §3 for each.

**Phase 15 (current) is actively in progress -- `plan_audio.md`'s `AUD-XX` numbering is the live
task list, 438 tasks total, most still open.** This is NOT a "wait for the user" state the way
Phase 9-14's closure was -- the user's own 2026-07-17 instruction authorized working through
`plan_audio.md` autonomously for an extended session. Concrete next candidates, in roughly the plan's
own recommended priority order (see `docs/cna_audio_deep_audit_2026-07-17.md`'s "Recommended
implementation order" and `plan_audio.md`'s own priority rules):

**Status as of commit `5e7235d0` (2026-07-18): `AUD-06` (25/25) and every `AUD-11` P0 item are
fully closed; `AUD-11-005/006/007/014/016/017/018/023/024/026` (P1) are also closed -- do not
re-pick any of those.** Also closed this same overall pass: `AUD-02` structured diagnostics,
`AUD-07-008`, `AUD-09`'s 5 golden Apply3D/Doppler cases, `AUD-10-005/006/013`,
`AUD-11-001/002/008/009/010/011/012/013`, all of `AUD-04-001` through `AUD-04-009`/`014`-`016`,
and `AUD-15-017`. The list below is refreshed accordingly.

**Further status update (2026-07-18, later same day, commit `761e98bb`): `AUD-11-025` (item 1
below) is now closed too (see §3's `AUD-11-025` entry), along with `AUD-15-005/006/007` and
`AUD-07-003` (see the "Continuing the same pass" note in §2) -- do not re-pick any of those.
`AUD-15-021` (new, open) tracks a pre-existing, unrelated intermittent test-suite segfault found
along the way. Item 5's "18 open" count in `AUD-15` is now lower; check `plan_audio.md` directly
for the current open list rather than trusting the count below. `AUD-07-005`/`006` (frame-alignment
validation for `SubmitBuffer`/`SubmitFloatBufferEXT`) are legitimate, open, well-scoped P0 tasks
worth picking up next in that area -- design and verify fresh (see the process note in §2).**

**Final status update for this pass (2026-07-18, commits `a55b4e8b`/`9842b498`/`2aa7c1d6`, latest
HEAD): `AUD-11-025` (item 1 below, already noted closed above) and `AUD-15-008` are now BOTH
closed -- item 1's "most concrete, well-scoped next task" framing below is stale, do not re-pick
`AUD-11-025`. `AUD-15-008`'s evidence: the one real forbidden-operation site found
(`OnFireAndForgetStopped`'s cleanup queue, mutex+reallocating-vector on the mixer thread) was
rewritten lock-free; see §2 and `plan_audio.md`'s own `AUD-15-008` entry.
**Two open, undiagnosed, `gdb`/`valgrind`-blocked investigations now exist side by side:**
`AUD-15-021` (flaky, ~20-40%, needs ~1300 tests) and `AUD-15-022` (new, 100%-reproducible-in-
isolation with just `CueTest.*:DynamicSoundEffectInstanceTest.*`, likely tied to this session's own
`AUD-15-006`/`AUD-07-003` stress tests -- see §2's fuller writeup and `plan_audio.md`'s own entry
for the full bisection trail). **Recommended next step, in order:** (1) if `gdb`/`valgrind` become
available, tackle `AUD-15-022` first -- it is the cleaner, faster, 100%-reproducible repro and may
turn out to also explain `AUD-15-021`; (2) otherwise, `AUD-07-005`/`006` (frame-alignment
validation, real open P0 tasks, no special tooling needed -- see the process note in §2) or the
remaining `AUD-15` P1 items (`009`-`016`, benchmarks and hardening, see item 5 below) are both
good, self-contained, non-blocked next picks.**

1. **`AUD-11-025`** (P1) -- WaveBank `Dispose()` racing a concurrent `GetSoundEffect()` decode is
   a confirmed real gap (investigated, documented, not yet fixed). Needs the same
   generation-counter/liveness-check pattern `AUD-04-008/009` already established on this exact
   codebase (`AudioMixer::GetMixerGeneration()` + `SoundEffectInstance::GetLiveTrackHandle()`), not
   a plain mutex -- the most concrete, well-scoped next task.
2. **`AUD-11`'s remaining P1/P2 items** (`019`-`022`, `027`-`028`, 6 open) -- zero-length/tiny
   entries, padding, old XWB versions, seek tables, WAV-wrapper field validation, an XWB
   inspection tool (mirrors `AUD-06-025`'s pattern). The new `XactParserFuzzTests.cpp` mutation
   harness already incidentally exercises `019`/`020`'s edge cases across 6000 mutations with zero
   findings; a few of these may turn out to already be adequately covered on inspection, matching
   this pass's `AUD-11-015`/`023` pattern (investigate first, don't assume a gap).
3. **`AUD-04`'s remaining items** (10 open) -- `AUD-04-002/003` (device-negotiation pitch
   preservation) need a real, non-dummy audio backend to test meaningfully -- may have to stay
   documented-as-untestable-headlessly. `AUD-04-010/011` (device change/loss handling) need a
   design decision (migrate-vs-stop-with-event) before implementing -- confirm with the user first,
   per §9. `AUD-04-012/013/017/018/019/020` (P1/P2 latency/capability/documentation items) are more
   readily self-startable.
4. **`AUD-05`'s remaining 2 items** (`AUD-05-010/011`, endianness policy + a NOXNA buffer
   descriptor) are both deliberately-deferred design-decision items -- do not silently pick these,
   confirm scope with the user first (see §9).
5. **`AUD-15`'s remaining thread-safety/lifetime items** (18 open) -- this session found and fixed
   *four* real memory-safety/concurrency defects via exactly this kind of "what if X runs
   concurrently with Y" or "what if this file is truncated/corrupt" testing (the mixer-generation
   UAF pair, the XACT name-parsing heap-buffer-overflow, the WaveBank cache race); `AUD-15`'s own
   remaining items (concurrent submit/dispose races, Dispose-during-callback, etc.) are a natural,
   proven-fruitful continuation of the same investigative approach.

**Environment note for the next session:** a full whole-repo (or TSAN) build may be transiently
blocked if the sibling `meta-gl`/`easy-gl` repos (shared across this machine's `cna*` project
family, referenced via CMake `add_subdirectory` from sibling directories) are mid-edit by another
concurrent process -- check `git status`/`git diff --stat` in those sibling repos before assuming
a build failure is caused by anything on this branch (it was not, the one time this happened
2026-07-18 -- see §3's `AUD-11-024` entry).

**`AUD-11` is now FULLY CLOSED (2026-07-18, commit `be9b39ea`): 28/28 tasks `[x]`, 0 open.** 5 more
commits after `ed3b16b6`: `AUD-11-025` was upgraded from "investigated but not fixed" to a real,
ASan-reproduced fix -- the initially-proposed generation-counter shape (matching `AUD-04-008/009`)
turned out to be over-engineered for this specific case (`Dispose()` and `GetSoundEffect()` are
both methods on the *same* `WaveBank` instance, so a single mutex serializing both against each
other is sufficient); a real `heap-use-after-free` was reproduced and fixed. `AUD-11-019`/`020`:
zero-length entries and padding-between-entries both confirmed already-safe by construction, new
tests lock it in. `AUD-11-021`: found a genuine, real gap -- every existing fixture in this
codebase used the older XWB header format (`version<=43`); the newer format (`version>43`, extra
`headerVersion` field) had zero coverage anywhere despite a real desync risk if the branch were
ever wrong -- closed with a new test, confirmed to catch a deliberately-broken branch condition.
`AUD-11-022`: seek tables confirmed genuinely not applicable (real FAudio source shows they're
only used for XMA2/WMA, neither of which CNA decodes). `AUD-11-027`/`028`: the WAV wrapper's own
byte-level output had never been directly tested (only indirectly via "did SDL3 decode it") --
closed with 6 new direct field-level tests, plus a new standalone `cna_xwb_inspect` tool
(metadata-JSON + `.wav` export, mirrors `AUD-06-025`'s pattern) verified end-to-end against a real
hand-built fixture. **Incidental finding, not fixed (out of scope):** a whole-repo test run hit a
real crash (`malloc(): unsorted double linked list corrupted`) in an unrelated `ENetBackendTest` --
consistent with the already-documented `NetworkSession::Dispose()` double-free corrupting heap
metadata that later surfaces unpredictably; confirmed via an isolated audio-scoped rerun (660/660
pass) that this is unrelated to any commit on this branch. See the project memory file for detail.
With both `AUD-06` and `AUD-11` now fully closed, the next natural section to pick up is `AUD-15`
(thread-safety/lifetime, 18 open) -- this pass's own investigative pattern ("what if X runs
concurrently with Y," "what if this file is truncated/corrupt") found and fixed real defects
repeatedly, and should transfer directly.

**Do not re-run a fresh full audit or restart from AUD-00** -- the audit and the 438-task plan
already exist; work through the existing list. See §9 for what to still confirm with the user
before doing (backend/API-surface changes), which remains unchanged from before.

---

## 9. Do not do yet

- **No re-running a fresh full "line-by-line vs FNA" audit.** Phase 7 and Phase 8 already did two
  rounds of that.
- **No silently picking a Phase 10 item that is real feature/behavior work and just starting it.**
  Confirm scope with the user first, especially for the two explicit design-only RFCs
  (`P10-PAN-002`, `P10-HRTF-002`), which are proposals, not approved work. A pure test-addition or
  read-only verification-sweep item can still be self-selected without asking, but **as of this
  pass there is none left on the Phase 10 list** — every remaining candidate needs confirmed scope.
- **No re-litigating a resolved open decision without the user asking first** — see `plan_audio.md`
  for the full list of resolved decisions (XACT filter fidelity, `Cue` lifecycle semantics, fade
  timing, instance-limit scope, `Apply3D` pan-orientation scope, RPC continuity scope).
- **No Media namespace work** — explicitly out of scope for this branch.
- **No FAudio/FACT migration** — the backend is SDL3_mixer by design.
- **No real 3D HRTF, Doppler-beyond-what's-implemented, or reverb implementation** — SDL3_mixer
  cannot do full HRTF/reverb; keep as documented accepted deviations unless the user explicitly
  asks to revisit the backend choice.
- **No touching the sibling `../sharp-runtime` checkout** without asking — separate repo under
  concurrent development.
- **No API renames / namespace moves** — XNA names are frozen.
- **No broad refactors or unrelated cleanup** — every fix on this branch has been a small,
  targeted change plus its own regression test; keep it that way.

## 10. Resume prompt

```
Read NEXT.md first, then plan_audio.md (the AUD-XX task list is authoritative for new work; the
archived plan_audio20260717.md is historical only, do not read/use it). Phases 9-14
(P#-XXX-NNN IDs) are all closed and historical. Phase 15 (AUD-XX-NNN IDs, 438 tasks, started
2026-07-17 from an independent deep audit) is the CURRENT, ACTIVE work -- most tasks are still
open. This is not a "wait for the user" state: keep working through plan_audio.md's task list in
priority order (see §8 for concrete next candidates) unless told otherwise.

1. Pick the next task from §8/plan_audio.md's own priority order. Validate every important claim
   against current code/tests/FNA/FAudio/SDL docs before implementing -- do not "fix" parser/math
   behavior from a comment or audit claim alone; confirm with a fixture or authoritative source
   first (see AUD-11-001/002's entry in §3 for why this matters -- the audit's own suspicion was
   wrong once checked against real FAudio source).
2. Make one small, verified improvement at a time: add/extend a test, verify with the git-stash
   pattern (§7) for any behavioral fix, run the relevant build/test command, and run ASan+UBSan if
   it touches memory lifetime or ownership.
3. Update plan_audio.md's checkbox + evidence note for whatever sub-item was completed (mark [x]
   only with concrete evidence, per the plan's own completion rules), then update this NEXT.md
   (status, recent changes, next task) to reflect what changed, and commit -- one task, one commit.
4. Do not stop after one task. Continue to the next item; do not end the session merely because
   one phase/bug/test passes.
```
