// Task 12.1 regression test for DEFERRED.md item #19 (../cna-samples), confirmed live while
// porting ClientServerSample: NetworkSession::Create()/Find()/Join() used to spin forever
// (99% CPU) whenever GamerServicesDispatcher::Initialize() had already run — i.e. whenever a
// GamerServicesComponent exists, exactly what every real XNA sample's own constructor does.
//
// Runs the reproduction in tools/net/gamerservices_dispatcher_harness.cpp as a genuinely separate
// OS process (not a TEST() body here) so that GamerServicesDispatcher::Initialize()'s
// process-lifetime static never contaminates this binary's other tests — see that harness file's
// own top-of-file comment, and the same caveat already documented in
// tests/Microsoft/Xna/Framework/GamerServices/GamerServicesServiceTests.cpp. Structurally mirrors
// tests/CNA/Internal/Net/TwoProcessLoopbackTest.cpp's spawn+watchdog helpers (Task 6.1), scaled
// down to one role and no cross-process handshake.
