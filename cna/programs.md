# programs.md — System Package Requirements (Debian 13 "trixie")

Everything needed to build, test, and debug this project (`cna_graphics` + the sibling
`sharp-runtime`/`easy-gl` repos) on a **fresh Debian 13** machine — desktop or headless. Compiled
by surveying `CMakeLists.txt` (`find_package`/`pkg_check_modules` calls), `cmake/ThirdPartySDL.cmake`
(SDL3 is built from a vendored git submodule, so its own *build* dependencies — X11, OpenGL, audio —
still need to come from the system), `CLAUDE.md`'s already-documented FFmpeg requirement, and what
was actually needed/used during real build+test+debug sessions in this repo.

Run the "Everything" block below on a brand-new machine and every backend/target in this repo
should build. The per-category sections underneath explain *why* each package is there, so you can
trim it down if you only need one backend.

---

## Everything (copy-paste)

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y \
  build-essential gcc g++ cmake ninja-build git pkg-config \
  libx11-dev libxext-dev libxrandr-dev libxinerama-dev libxcursor-dev libxi-dev \
  libxfixes-dev libxss-dev \
  libgl1-mesa-dev libegl1-mesa-dev libglu1-mesa-dev mesa-common-dev \
  libasound2-dev libpulse-dev \
  libvulkan-dev vulkan-tools vulkan-validationlayers mesa-vulkan-drivers \
  libavcodec-dev libavformat-dev libavutil-dev libswresample-dev \
  zlib1g-dev \
  xvfb mesa-utils \
  apitrace apitrace-tracers
```

That's the full desktop-Linux (EasyGL + Vulkan + Bgfx + SDL_Renderer) build+test+debug set. See
below for what each line is for, and what's optional.

---

## 1. Core build toolchain

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y build-essential gcc g++ cmake ninja-build git pkg-config
```

- **`build-essential`, `gcc`, `g++`** — this project requires a **C++23-capable compiler**
  (GCC 12+ or Clang 15+ per `README.md`). Verified working: GCC 14.2.0 (Debian 14.2.0-19).
- **`cmake`** — 3.20+ required (`cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.20)` in `CMakeLists.txt`).
  Verified working: 3.31.6.
- **`ninja-build`** — optional but recommended; CMake defaults to Make otherwise, both work.
- **`git`** — needed for `git submodule update --init --recursive` (vendored SDL3/SDL_image/
  SDL_mixer at `third_party/`) and to clone the sibling `../sharp-runtime` and `../easy-gl` repos.
- **`pkg-config`** — `CMakeLists.txt` calls `find_package(PkgConfig REQUIRED)` directly for the
  FFmpeg libraries (§4).

## 2. SDL3 build dependencies (X11 / OpenGL / audio)

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y \
  libx11-dev libxext-dev libxrandr-dev libxinerama-dev libxcursor-dev libxi-dev \
  libxfixes-dev libxss-dev \
  libgl1-mesa-dev libegl1-mesa-dev libglu1-mesa-dev mesa-common-dev \
  libasound2-dev libpulse-dev
```

SDL3, SDL3_image, and SDL3_mixer are **built from vendored git submodules** (`third_party/SDL*`),
not installed as system packages (`README.md` §9 already covers this) — but building *that vendored
source* still needs the underlying platform dev headers SDL3 probes for at CMake-configure time.
This project always drives tests with `SDL_VIDEODRIVER=x11` (see `NEXT.md` §7), so the X11 dev
headers are the load-bearing ones; Wayland is not currently exercised by any test in this repo and
is deliberately omitted here (SDL3 will still build fine without Wayland dev headers — it just won't
offer that video driver).

- **X11 libs** (`libx11-dev` + `libxext-dev`/`libxrandr-dev`/`libxinerama-dev`/`libxcursor-dev`/
  `libxi-dev`/`libxfixes-dev`/`libxss-dev`) — SDL3's X11 video backend.
- **`libgl1-mesa-dev`, `libegl1-mesa-dev`, `libglu1-mesa-dev`, `mesa-common-dev`** — OpenGL/EGL
  headers. Needed by: SDL3's own GL context creation, the `EASYGL` backend (`../easy-gl`, GL ES
  3.2 via the `easy-gl` wrapper), and the `BGFX` backend (bgfx creates its own context via **EGL**
  on Linux — see `bgfx/src/glcontext_egl.cpp` — not GLX).
- **`libasound2-dev`, `libpulse-dev`** — SDL3's audio backends (ALSA, PulseAudio), used by
  `Microsoft::Xna::Framework::Audio`/`SDL3_mixer`.

## 3. Vulkan

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y libvulkan-dev vulkan-tools vulkan-validationlayers mesa-vulkan-drivers
```

- **`libvulkan-dev`** — `CMakeLists.txt` calls `find_package(Vulkan REQUIRED)` when
  `CNA_GRAPHICS_BACKEND=VULKAN`.
- **`vulkan-tools`** — `vulkaninfo`, useful for confirming what the machine actually exposes
  (physical devices, extensions) before debugging a Vulkan-backend test failure.
- **`vulkan-validationlayers`** — surfaces real API-misuse bugs immediately in Vulkan backend
  development (this project's Vulkan backend logs `[Vulkan Validation]` messages when they fire).
- **`mesa-vulkan-drivers`** — provides **lavapipe** (software Vulkan, `llvmpipe`-backed), the
  fallback `VK_PHYSICAL_DEVICE_TYPE_CPU` device used automatically on machines with no real Vulkan
  GPU or under a virtual display (`Xvfb`) with no GPU passthrough — this is what makes the Vulkan
  backend's tests runnable at all on a headless CI-style box.

## 4. FFmpeg (video decoding)

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y libavcodec-dev libavformat-dev libavutil-dev libswresample-dev
```

Already documented in `CLAUDE.md` ("System Dependencies (Linux)") — required for
`Microsoft::Xna::Framework::Media`'s `VideoPlayer`. Note: `libswscale-dev` is **not** required —
CNA implements YUV→RGBA conversion internally rather than depending on `libswscale` headers (per
`CLAUDE.md`); the runtime `libswscale8`/`libswscale9` shared library pulled in transitively by
`libavcodec`/`libavformat` is enough.

## 5. Networking / misc

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y zlib1g-dev
```

- **`zlib1g-dev`** — the sibling `../sharp-runtime` repo's own `CMakeLists.txt` calls
  `find_package(ZLIB REQUIRED)` directly.
- **ENet** (backing `Microsoft::Xna::Framework::Net`) is vendored directly at `third_party/enet` —
  no system package needed.

## 6. Headless testing environment

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y xvfb mesa-utils
```

- **`xvfb`** — this sandbox has no real X server on `:0` by default for automated test runs; every
  GPU/window-creating test binary in this repo's `ctest` suite runs against a virtual `Xvfb` display
  (conventionally `:99` in this project's own session notes — see `NEXT.md` §7's "Environment
  note"). Start it with e.g. `Xvfb :99 -screen 0 1280x1024x24 &` before running any
  `SDL_VIDEODRIVER=x11 DISPLAY=:99 ...` command.
- **`mesa-utils`** — provides `glxinfo` (`glxinfo -B` is the fastest way to check what GL version a
  given `DISPLAY` actually negotiates/supports — this was essential when root-causing why bgfx's
  OpenGL backend reports "OpenGL 2.1" even though the underlying driver supports much more).

> **Note on real GPU vs. software rendering**: if the target machine has a real GPU with proper
> kernel driver support (confirmed in this project's own sandbox: `glxinfo -B` on the *real* display
> shows a hardware-accelerated `radeonsi`/AMD device up to GL 4.6), an `Xvfb` virtual display will
> still typically fall back to **llvmpipe** (software Mesa) unless it's specifically configured with
> GPU passthrough (e.g. `Xvfb` + DRI3, or running tests against the real display instead). Both
> paths work for this project's tests; llvmpipe is just slower and has its own quirks (documented in
> `NEXT.md` §5 — e.g. bgfx's OpenGL backend negotiating only a legacy GL 2.1 context in this
> specific software-GL environment).

## 7. Debugging tools

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y apitrace apitrace-tracers
```

- **`apitrace`** (+ `apitrace-tracers`, the `LD_PRELOAD`-based OpenGL/EGL call interceptor) — traces
  the exact sequence of GL calls (with arguments) a test binary issues; used to debug a real,
  still-open bug (Task 952, `plan_graphics.md`) where a `RenderTargetCube` face's FBO silently stops
  producing color output the instant a depth texture is attached, with **no GL error at all**
  (confirmed via `MESA_DEBUG=1 LIBGL_DEBUG=verbose`, which also needs no extra package — both are
  Mesa runtime env vars, not separate tools). Works fully headless — no GUI needed
  (`apitrace-gui`/`qapitrace` is the optional Qt frontend, not required for `apitrace dump`).
- **RenderDoc** is **not available in the default Debian 13 apt repos** (`apt-cache search renderdoc`
  returns nothing) — download the Linux tarball directly from
  [renderdoc.org](https://renderdoc.org) (e.g. to `~/Downloads/renderdoc_<version>`, no install step
  needed — `bin/`, `lib/`, `include/` are all self-contained). **Real findings from actually using it
  in this sandbox (2026-07-11, Task 952)**, so a future session doesn't have to re-discover them:
    - `bgfx` only calls its own RenderDoc auto-load when `bgfx::Init::debug` or `::profile` is `true`
      (CNA sets neither) — the harmless `BX WARN dlopen failed` log line you'll see by default is
      this, **not** evidence RenderDoc itself is missing/broken.
    - Getting a capture requires `LD_PRELOAD=<path>/lib/librenderdoc.so <binary>`, not a plain
      runtime `dlopen()` from within your own code — RenderDoc's hooking only intercepts a
      subsequent `dlopen("libGL.so.1")` if it's preloaded first (same requirement as `apitrace`'s
      own interposer).
    - A capture only actually gets recorded on a frame submitted via
      `bgfx::frame(BGFX_FRAME_DEBUG_CAPTURE)` (a real public bgfx flag) — or by calling RenderDoc's
      own `RENDERDOC_API_1_6_0::StartFrameCapture`/`EndFrameCapture` directly (works from any code in
      the process once the library is loaded, not just from bgfx's internal integration).
    - **`qrenderdoc --python <script>.py`** (this Linux tarball's *only* way to get the
      `import renderdoc` Python scripting API — it ships no standalone importable module, only
      `qrenderdoc`'s own embedded interpreter) **hangs indefinitely under this sandbox's `Xvfb`**,
      even with `QT_DEBUG_PLUGINS=1`; `qrenderdoc --version` (no GUI) returns instantly, and a plain
      `xterm` on the same `DISPLAY` works fine, so it's specific to Qt/XCB init with no window
      manager installed (§6 already notes none is present) — `--platform offscreen`/`minimal` are
      **not** compiled into this particular RenderDoc release (`Available platform plugins are: xcb`
      only). Not solved as of this writing — would need either a minimal WM installed alongside
      `Xvfb`, or a RenderDoc build with the `offscreen` Qt platform plugin.
    - **`renderdoccmd convert -c zip.xml -f cap.rdc -o out.xml` works perfectly headless** (no GUI,
      no hang) and is a genuinely useful substitute for a lot of what the GUI would show: a fully
      structured, `grep`/Python-parseable XML dump of every recorded GL call, in bgfx's *actual
      view-processing order* (not just call-issue order like `apitrace dump`), including every
      argument. `renderdoccmd thumb -o out.png <capture>.rdc` extracts a quick sanity-check
      thumbnail. Both were sufficient to rule out several hypotheses (FBO handle validity, view-id
      targeting, texture-handle identity) with hard evidence — see `plan_graphics.md`'s Task 952
      entry for what was actually found this way. What's still blocked without the GUI: pixel
      history / arbitrary internal-texture readback (only exposed via the Python API or the GUI's
      own texture viewer), which is what's needed to finish Task 952.

## 8. Optional: Windows cross-compilation (MinGW-w64)

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y mingw-w64
```

Only needed for `-DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=cmake/toolchains/mingw-w64.cmake` builds (see `README.md`
§9, "Build (Linux → Windows cross-compilation with MinGW-w64)"). Not needed for any Linux-native
backend.

## 9. Optional: D3D11 backend Wine+DXVK dev loop (`plan_dx.md`)

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y dxvk-wine64
```

Only needed if you're working on the `D3D11`/`D3D12` graphics backend plan (`plan_dx.md`, not yet
implemented as of this writing — Phase DX1 only). Not needed for any other backend or task in this
repo. Builds on §8 (`mingw-w64`) — this is the piece that lets a cross-compiled `D3D11` `.exe`
actually be *run and pixel-tested* on this Debian machine instead of only compiled.

- **`dxvk-wine64`** — DXVK (Vulkan-based Direct3D 8/9/10/11 translation layer for Wine), the 64-bit
  build. Pulls in two more packages automatically via `Recommends`: **`dxvk`** (a small meta-package
  that ships `dxvk-setup(1)`, a Debian-specific install/uninstall helper — nicer than manually
  symlinking DLLs into a Wine prefix) and **`dxvk-wine32:i386`** (the 32-bit build; not needed by
  this project, which only targets `x86_64-w64-mingw32`, but harmless to have). If you want to skip
  the unneeded 32-bit build: `sudo apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends dxvk-wine64`.
- Wine itself (`wine`/`wine64`/`libwine` packages) does **not** need a separate install command here
  — it's already covered by whatever installed `wine`/`winetricks` on this machine previously (not
  itself part of this project's build requirements list, since only the `D3D11`/`D3D12` plan needs
  it). **Real environment finding**: this Debian's Wine 10.0 packaging has **no separate `wine64`
  command** — only `wine`, which auto-detects a PE32 vs. PE32+ (32/64-bit) executable and runs it
  correctly either way. Scripts/docs written against older Wine docs that assume `wine64` exists as
  its own binary will need to use `wine` instead (see `scripts/run-wine-dxvk.sh`).

**Setting up a dedicated Wine prefix with DXVK installed** (this project's own convention —
`plan_dx.md` `DX-2`, keeps this isolated from any other Wine prefix you might have):

```bash
export WINEPREFIX=~/.wine-cna-d3d11
wineboot --init
dxvk-setup install
```

`dxvk-setup install` symlinks `system32/d3d11.dll`/`dxgi.dll` (and the other D3D8/9/10 DLLs) inside
`$WINEPREFIX` directly to `/usr/lib/dxvk/wine64/*.dll.so` and sets the matching
`HKCU\Software\Wine\DllOverrides` registry entries to `native` — Debian's own DXVK integration loads
the `.so` build directly as a "native" module, rather than the typical upstream-DXVK-zip approach of
copying `.dll` files and setting `native,builtin` overrides. Functionally equivalent; worth knowing
if you're cross-referencing DXVK's own upstream install instructions, which describe the zip-based
approach instead.

**Verifying DXVK is actually engaged, not silently falling back to `WineD3D`** — this is the one
easy way to get a false sense of security (running under Wine ≠ running under DXVK specifically),
so always check the log, not just "did it run without crashing":

```bash
export WINEPREFIX=~/.wine-cna-d3d11
export DXVK_LOG_PATH=/tmp/dxvk-logs
export DXVK_LOG_LEVEL=info
scripts/run-wine-dxvk.sh path/to/your.exe
cat /tmp/dxvk-logs/*.log | head -5
```

A real DXVK run's log starts with lines like `DXVK: 2.6.0`, `Build: x86_64 gcc ...`, and a real
adapter name (e.g. `AMD Radeon 780M (RADV PHOENIX)` on this machine, via the `radv` Mesa Vulkan
driver — `llvmpipe`, the CPU/software Vulkan adapter, is explicitly skipped and logged as such
unless no real GPU is available). If DXVK's DLL override isn't actually in effect, the same D3D11
calls would instead go through Wine's own built-in `WineD3D` — which also runs without crashing, so
a missing/absent DXVK log file (not an error!) is the actual tell, not a visible failure.

### D3D9 backend: three separate Wine prefixes (`plan_dx9.md`, `D9-130`)

The `D3D9` backend (`plan_dx9.md`) needs the same `dxvk-wine64` package as above, but uses **three
separate Wine prefixes** for three different jobs — using the wrong one wastes real time, since a
prefix missing the right DLL still runs, just silently wrong (see `plan_dx9.md`'s own "The Wine
prefixes already exist" note):

- **`~/.wine-cna-d3d9-spike`** (or `~/.wine-cna-d3d11`, the default `CNA_D3D9_WINEPREFIX` falls
  back to if unset) — the normal CNA-side D3D9 dev-loop prefix, DXVK-enabled the same way as §9
  above. This is what `scripts/run-wine-dxvk9.sh` and every `D3D9`-labeled CTest actually run
  against.
- **`~/.wine-cna-d3d9-spike`** specifically — also has the **real Microsoft `d3dcompiler_47.dll`**
  (not Wine's builtin, which cannot compile SM2/SM3 shaders at all). Needed for any task that
  compiles HLSL, not just runs already-compiled shaders.
- **`~/.wine-cna-xna40`** — has the **real XNA 4.0 runtime** installed (win32, .NET Framework 4.0,
  the full GAC, an in-prefix `csc.exe`) plus DXVK, so the oracle's XNA-side render goes through the
  same Direct3D-9-over-Vulkan path as the CNA-side render. Only needed for *regenerating* the
  checked-in `tools/xna-oracle/reference/*.png` files (`D9-A`) — not needed to run the already-
  checked-in `D3D9_XNA_Diff` CTest, which only diffs against those PNGs.

```bash
export WINEPREFIX=~/.wine-cna-d3d9-spike
wineboot --init
dxvk-setup install
# then install the real d3dcompiler_47.dll and, for ~/.wine-cna-xna40, the XNA 4.0 GAC —
# see dx9-spike/README.md for exactly what is in each prefix and how they were built.
```

`CNA_D3D9_WINEPREFIX` (env var) selects which prefix `scripts/run-wine-dxvk9.sh` targets; the
script fails loudly (exit 3) if a run silently fell back to `WineD3D` instead of DXVK, same
verification discipline as §9 above.

## 10. Out of scope here: Android (NDK)

Android cross-compilation needs the Android NDK (not an apt package — a separate SDK/NDK download
and toolchain file), and is currently **blocked** by pre-existing build regressions in the sibling
`sharp-runtime` repo unrelated to system packages (`NEXT.md`/`plan_graphics.md` Task 920). Not
included in the list above; set up the NDK separately if/when that work resumes.

---

## After installing: initialize submodules and sibling repos

System packages alone aren't enough — this repo also needs:

```bash
# Vendored SDL3/SDL_image/SDL_mixer submodules
git submodule update --init --recursive

# Sibling repos (separate git checkouts, NOT submodules — must live next to this repo's own directory)
cd ..
git clone https://github.com/openeggbert/sharp-runtime.git
git clone https://github.com/openeggbert/easy-gl.git   # only needed for the EASYGL backend
```

See `README.md` §9 for the full build commands per backend once all of the above is in place.
