# plan_dx9.md Phase D9-7 (D9-70): mechanically enforce "not one line edited" for the vendored
# Microsoft XNA 4.0 Stock Effects HLSL sources -- design decision 3 says these files must stay
# byte-identical to the FNA reference tree; this script is that enforcement, not just a comment.
#
# Usage: scripts/verify-d3d9-stock-effects-vendored.sh [path-to-FNA-tree]
# Defaults to /rv/data/library/github.com/FNA-XNA/FNA (this project's own documented reference
# tree location, per CLAUDE.md's "Source Reference"). Override via the first argument or
# CNA_FNA_TREE if the reference tree lives somewhere else on a given machine.
#
# Exit code 0 = every vendored file is byte-identical to the FNA tree; 1 = at least one delta
# (printed as a diff), or the FNA tree/vendored directory could not be found.
