# Task 457: cross-backend smoke-test orchestrator.
#
# Configures (if needed), builds, and runs each graphics backend's own 3-frame
# smoke test (Tasks 85/88/89/730, CTest label "GraphicsSmoke") sequentially --
# never concurrently, matching this project's own testing discipline -- using
# the persistent per-backend build directories this project already uses
# locally (cmake-build-debug=EASYGL, cmake-build-vulkan, cmake-build-bgfx,
# cmake-build-sdl).
#
# A backend whose build directory does not exist and cannot be freshly
# configured (e.g. missing system dependencies such as the Vulkan SDK) is
# reported as "not available on this machine" and skipped rather than failing
# the whole run -- matching this task's own "every backend available on the
# machine" framing. A backend that DOES configure/build but whose smoke test
# fails makes the overall run fail (non-zero exit), so this composes cleanly
# as a CI step if/when this project's CI is extended to call it.
