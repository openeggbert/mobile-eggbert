# plan_dx.md DX-102/DX-114: run a Windows cross-compiled .exe (D3D12 backend) through a REAL,
# properly Steam/Proton-managed launch -- distinct from run-wine-vkd3d.sh, which runs vkd3d-proton's
# d3d12.dll/d3d12core.dll natively-overridden inside a hand-built *system* Wine prefix.
#
# Why this script exists: run-wine-vkd3d.sh's approach proves the D3D12 device/queue/heap/command-
# list/fence path (real, works well), but CreateSwapChainForHwnd crashes under it -- root-caused
# (2026-07-14) to a genuine ABI/integration mismatch: Debian's *system* dxgi.dll (paired with
# system Wine's own wined3d.dll/kernel32.dll/etc, all from one consistent build) cannot hand a
# D3D12 command queue to vkd3d-proton's separately-overridden d3d12.dll -- vkd3d-proton's own
# dxgi.dll (the one that DOES understand this handoff) is only ABI-compatible with the REST of
# Proton's own matched Wine build (its own wined3d.dll, its own libvkd3d-*.dll support libraries,
# etc.), not with a foreign system Wine installation piecemeal.
#
# This script runs the target .exe through Proton's own `proton run` launcher (found via this
# machine's local Steam "Proton - Experimental" install -- the same source run-wine-vkd3d.sh's own
# vkd3d-proton DLLs came from), in a dedicated Proton-managed prefix (STEAM_COMPAT_DATA_PATH) that
# is Proton's own self-consistent DLL set end to end -- not the hand-built system-Wine prefix
# run-wine-vkd3d.sh uses. vkd3d-proton's d3d12.dll/d3d12core.dll (its own, standalone "vkd3d-proton"
# subdirectory build, distinct from whatever Proton's own *default* D3D12 support is) are layered
# on top as a native DLL override, exactly like run-wine-vkd3d.sh's own approach -- the difference
# is *everything else* (dxgi.dll, wined3d.dll, libvkd3d-*.dll, kernel32.dll, ...) now comes from
# one single, mutually-consistent Proton build instead of a system Wine + foreign DLL patchwork.
#
# Real result (2026-07-14, this exact script's manual predecessor): CreateSwapChainForHwnd genuinely
# returns S_OK through this launch path -- IsSwapChainAvailableEXT() == true, confirmed via
# examples/d3d12_swapchain_diag.cpp's own file-based log (proton's process-launch plumbing does not
# reliably forward the child's stdout back to the invoking shell -- write results to a file from
# within the target .exe if you need to read them back, not stdout).
#
# Usage: scripts/run-proton-vkd3d.sh <path-to.exe> [args...]
#
# Set CNA_D3D12_PROTON_DIR to override the "Proton - Experimental" install directory (auto-detected
# under ~/.steam/steam/steamapps/common by default). Set CNA_D3D12_PROTON_COMPAT_DATA_PATH to
# override the persistent prefix directory (defaults to ~/.wine-cna-d3d12-protonrun). The prefix is
# bootstrapped automatically on first use via Proton's own launcher -- no manual wineboot step
# needed (unlike run-wine-vkd3d.sh's hand-built system-Wine prefix).

#
# HARD refusal to ever operate on the developer's own default Wine prefix (~/.wine). This is not
# theoretical: on 2026-07-14 an earlier iteration of this script's own investigation ran Proton's
# `wine` binary WITHOUT WINEPREFIX set, so it fell back to ~/.wine -- the developer's real, personal
# prefix (with unrelated apps installed in it). Proton ships wine-11.0 while the system wine is
# 10.0, so that silently triggered an automatic prefix UPGRADE of ~/.wine: it rewrote system.reg/
# user.reg/userdef.reg/dosdevices, then HUNG forever on the setupapi "found new hardware" /
# install_mono wizard, leaving the personal prefix half-upgraded and two zombie Wine process trees
# running for 9.5 hours (visible as "steam_proton is not responding" desktop popups). The
# WINEPREFIX= assignments below are the actual fix for the fallback; this guard is the seatbelt in
# case a future edit ever drops one of them again.
