"""Reproducible visual regression check for demo_avatar, run against the REAL rendering pipeline
(real content, real AvatarRenderer, real GPU-skinned draw) - not a synthetic fixture.

audit_net.md remediation, fourth round (2026-07-18): the third-round version of this script
measured only *global* average brightness and a global very-dark-pixel fraction. The audit
correctly rejected that as insufficient - a global average can pass while a localized defect
(a jagged shoe/foot boundary, a black groin wedge) is still plainly visible. This version adds
per-REGION checks and, more importantly, a STRUCTURAL metric that targets the actual defect
shape rather than overall darkness:

  "speckle" = the number of dark pixels that are directly adjacent to a bright pixel.

That is what an interpenetration seam between two low-poly meshes looks like: the renderer
alternates between the two surfaces along a jagged intersection curve, producing many
dark/bright transitions packed into a small area. A smooth, correctly-shaded region - even a
legitimately dark one, like a shoe - has few such transitions, because its darkness is
contiguous. So speckle distinguishes "this area is dark" (fine) from "this area is shattered
into interleaved dark and light fragments" (the real defect).

Regions are fixed pixel boxes. That is reproducible because the demo's camera is fully
determined by --gender/--yaw/--clip, which this script pins.

Usage:
    python3 scripts/avatar_visual_regression_check.py [--build-dir cmake-build-debug]
    python3 scripts/avatar_visual_regression_check.py --report   # print metrics, never fail

Requires: a built cna_demo_avatar in --build-dir, Pillow, and headless xvfb-run.
Exit 0 = all checks at or better than their recorded floor. Exit 1 = a regression.

IMPORTANT: passing does NOT mean the avatar looks correct. It means it has not regressed below
the state recorded when these thresholds were last updated. See NEXTnet.md's avatar section for
the list of defects still known to be open.
