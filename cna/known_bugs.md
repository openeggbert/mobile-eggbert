# CNA Known Bugs

## Multiple SpriteBatch Begin/End in one frame discards all but the last

**Backend:** Vulkan (confirmed), others unknown.

**Symptom:** If `SpriteBatch::Begin()` / `SpriteBatch::End()` is called more than once
within a single `Draw()` frame, only the draws from the **last** Begin/End pair are
visible. All earlier sprite draws are silently discarded.

**Example:**
```cpp
// Frame Draw():
spriteBatch->Begin();
spriteBatch->Draw(background, Vector2::Zero, Color(255,255,255,255));
spriteBatch->End();   // ← this batch is LOST

spriteBatch->Begin();
spriteBatch->Draw(tank, tankPos, Color(255,255,255,255));
spriteBatch->End();   // ← only this batch renders
```

**Workaround:** Merge all sprite draws into a single `Begin()` / `End()` per frame.
If mixing SpriteBatch with PrimitiveBatch (`DrawUserPrimitives`), call
`spriteBatch->End()` first, then draw primitives, then start a new SpriteBatch
only if strictly necessary — but prefer keeping everything in one batch.

**Discovered in:** cna-samples #021 PathDrawing port (2026-06-27).
