     * singletons (e.g. Microsoft::Xna::Framework::Audio::Microphone) are
     * shaped.

     * from device selection so that this class never competes with
     * Microsoft::Xna::Framework::Input::GamePad::SetVibration() for the same
     * physical actuator; if the only haptic-capable device present is a game
     * controller, Start() is a silent no-op, matching the behavior of a
