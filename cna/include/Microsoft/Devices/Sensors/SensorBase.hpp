         * instances with different TimeBetweenUpdates values throttle
         * independently, as required.
         *
         * Deliberately `std::chrono::steady_clock`, not `System::DateTimeOffset`
         * wall-clock time — see `lastAcceptedUpdateTime_`'s own doc comment
         * for why a throttle *decision* must use a clock the standard
         * guarantees never steps backward or jumps. `TimeBetweenUpdates`
