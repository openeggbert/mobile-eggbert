     * @brief Specifies the current state of a sensor.
     *
     * This is a C++ counterpart of the .NET
     * Microsoft.Devices.Sensors.SensorState enumeration. `Accelerometer::State`
     * is the one real, strict-XNA-API member of this enum's real WP7 users
     * (`Gyroscope`/`Compass`/`Motion`'s own `State` properties are `NOXNA`
     * extensions added for symmetry — see each class's own `getStateProperty()`
     * doc comment).
     *
     * Task BASE2-003 (2026-07-17, external audit `audit_devices_2026-07-17.md`):
     * this codebase's current, verified reachability per value, confirmed by
     * reading every `state_ = SensorState::...` assignment in
     * `Accelerometer.cpp`/`Gyroscope.cpp`/`Compass.cpp`/`Motion.cpp` directly
     * (not assumed): `NotSupported`/`Initializing`/`Ready`/`Disabled` are
     * produced by all four classes today; `NoData`/`NoPermissions` are
     * produced by **none** of them. This is documented honestly as "currently
     * never produced, unverified against real WP7 behavior" rather than
     * "intentionally never produced" — this codebase has no local WP7 SDK/
     * MonoGame reference to confirm whether real `Accelerometer.State` (the
     * one strict-API member) is actually documented to ever report `NoData`/
     * `NoPermissions`, or under what real-device condition (e.g. Android's
     * basic motion sensors — accelerometer/gyroscope/magnetometer/rotation
     * vector — do not require a runtime permission grant in Android's own
     * permission model, which would make `NoPermissions` plausibly
     * unreachable on this project's supported platforms specifically, but
     * this has not been independently confirmed against Android's official
     * documentation the way other platform-contract claims in this codebase
     * have been). See `plan_devices.md`'s `BASE2-003`/`DEVPERF-002`/`003`
     * entries for the full reasoning and what remains open.
