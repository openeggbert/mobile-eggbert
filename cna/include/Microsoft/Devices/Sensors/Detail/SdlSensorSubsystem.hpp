     * SDL_INIT_SENSOR subsystem — a class-specific lock does nothing to stop
     * Accelerometer's and Gyroscope's real SDL calls from running fully
     * concurrently with each other. SDL3's own documentation states
     * SDL_InitSubSystem() "should only be called on the main thread" and
     * SDL_QuitSubSystem() "is not thread safe"; SDL_GetSensors()/
     * SDL_OpenSensor()/SDL_GetSensorType()/SDL_CloseSensor() carry no
     * `\threadsafety` annotation at all, so none of them can be assumed safe
     * for concurrent access either. This single mutex serializes all of them
     * across both sensor classes.
     *
     * Task SDLCORE-001 (2026-07-17, external audit `audit_devices_2026-07-17.md`):
     * this is now a thin forwarding call to
     * `Detail::GetGlobalSdlSubsystemMutex()` (`include/Microsoft/Devices/
     * Detail/SdlSubsystemMutex.hpp`) — the *same* process-wide mutex
     * `Detail::SdlHapticVibrateBackend` (`SDL_INIT_HAPTIC`, used by
     * `VibrateController`) now also uses, instead of each having its own,
     * entirely independent lock. Kept under this existing name (rather than
     * updating every call site in `Accelerometer.cpp`/`Gyroscope.cpp` to a
     * new name) purely to minimize diff — see that header's own doc comment
     * for the full rationale, including why this remains a plain mutex
     * rather than the audit's originally-suggested `SDL_RunOnMainThread()`-
     * based main-thread dispatch (a naive version of that redesign would
     * deadlock this project's own existing, legitimate multi-threaded
     * `Start()`/`Stop()` usage, since nothing in this project's Devices
     * usage guarantees an active SDL event pump to drain it).
     *
     * Lock order (Task P7-1): whenever a caller already holds a
     * `SdlSensorSubsystem<TSensor>::mutex_`, it must acquire *this* mutex
     * only after that lock (nest this mutex inside the per-class one), never
     * the reverse — see `Accelerometer::getIsSupportedProperty()`/`Start()`/
     * `Dispose(bool)` for the exact acquisition sites. `getIsSupportedProperty()`
     * acquires only this mutex (no per-class lock at all — `ProbeIsSupported()`
     * touches no per-class subsystem state), so it never participates in the
     * nesting order at all; this is safe precisely because it never also
     * holds a per-class `mutex_` while doing so.

         * Previously `startedInstances_` held raw `TSensor*` values directly,

         * checking whether that exact bit pattern was still present in the

         * from "a completely different, later TSensor instance happens to
         * have been allocated at the exact same address and is itself now
         * started" — the classic ABA hazard. Concretely: instance X is
         * snapshotted, then disposed and destroyed (freeing its memory)
         * *before* the dispatch loop reaches it; a brand-new instance Y is
         * then constructed at X's freed address and started, registering
         * that same address in `startedInstances_` again; the old
         * pointer-value revalidation would wrongly find "the address" still
         * present and dispatch a stale event — meant for whatever happened
         * while X was alive — into Y instead.
         *
         * The fix: a fresh `DispatchRegistration` is heap-allocated (via
         * `shared_ptr`) every time `RegisterStartedInstanceLocked()` runs,
         * and is never reused for a later, logically distinct registration —
         * not even a later `Start()` by the very same `TSensor` object after
         * an intervening `Stop()`. `startedInstances_` holds (and
         * `DispatchToInstances()` snapshots/iterates) these `shared_ptr`s,
         * never raw `TSensor*` values. `owner` is nulled by
         * `UnregisterStartedInstanceLocked()` — under `mutex_`, the same lock
         * every read of `owner` requires — strictly before that instance's
         * `Dispose(bool)` can finish waiting for in-flight dispatches and let
         * the object be destroyed (see `Accelerometer`/`Gyroscope`'s
         * `Dispose(bool)`). A dispatcher holding an old snapshot's
         * `shared_ptr<DispatchRegistration>` therefore always sees `owner ==
         * nullptr` once that specific registration is torn down, regardless
         * of whether some later, unrelated instance is later constructed at
         * the same address and separately registers its own, distinct

         * they can never be confused with each other.

         * exactly like every other field this class documents as

         * pushed into dispatchingThreadIds_ up front, before any of them
         * were dispatched to. If one instance's callback (e.g. instance A's
         * ProcessSensorUpdateEvent(), still mid-loop below) disposed a
         * *different*, not-yet-reached instance B from the same snapshot,
         * B's pre-pushed thread-id entry made its concurrent Dispose() call
         * look like a same-thread self-dispose (exempt from waiting) even
         * though nothing was actually executing inside B yet — B was fully
         * disposed (and possibly destroyed) with no wait at all, and this
         * loop would then blindly call `dispatchOne` on the now-dangling
         * `B*` on its next iteration.
         *
         * The fix: mark (and validate) each registration immediately before
         * dispatching to its instance, not in bulk up front. If a prior
         * iteration's callback already disposed a later instance in this
         * snapshot, that instance's own Dispose(bool)/Stop() has already
         * invalidated (and removed) its registration (necessarily before any
         * wait that could let it be destroyed) — so the `owner` re-check
         * here safely detects that and skips it, never touching
         * (dereferencing) the possibly-freed memory.
         *
         * Task SDLCORE-004: this per-registration `owner` re-check replaces
         * the previous pointer-value-only `std::find(startedInstances_...,
         * instance)` revalidation, which could not distinguish "the original
         * snapshotted instance is still started" from "a different, later
         * instance happens to have been allocated at the exact same address
         * and is itself now started" (a classic ABA hazard) — see
         * `DispatchRegistration`'s own doc comment for the full analysis.
         *
         * Task P8-1: the cleanup guard below still captures a *copy* of
         * `instance->dispatchToken_` (a `shared_ptr`), taken while `instance`
         * is confirmed still alive+started under the lock, instead of
         * capturing `instance` itself. This closes a further use-after-free:
         * if a callback *destroys* (not just Dispose()s) the exact instance
         * it was invoked for — `dispatchOne(instance)`, below — the cleanup
         * guard would previously dereference `instance->dispatchingThreadIds_`
         * on freed memory the moment it ran. The token, kept alive by the
         * guard's own captured shared_ptr, survives even if the instance does
         * not. This does not, and cannot, protect a TSensor-specific method
         * that itself keeps touching `this` after raising an event on the
         * same dispatch (e.g. Accelerometer::DispatchSensorReading() checking
         * `getIsDataValidProperty()` again before conditionally raising
         * ReadingChanged) — that is a class-design property, documented as
