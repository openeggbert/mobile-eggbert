     * `ICompassBackend`'s shape, including its calibration callback (Task
     * MOTION-011, 2026-07-16) — `Motion`'s own fused attitude depends on the
     * same magnetometer data `Compass`'s `Calibrate` logic reacts to, so a
     * real backend can detect and report the identical calibration-needed
     * condition through this interface.
