     * @brief Platform/device vibration-motor backend interface (Task VIB-002).
     *
     * `VibrateController` selects a concrete implementation
     * (`SdlHapticVibrateBackend` today) at construction time and calls
     * through this interface for every operation, instead of calling SDL3's
     * `SDL_Haptic` functions directly. This exists to separate two distinct
     * concepts that a single hardcoded SDL-haptic implementation previously
     * conflated: "the phone/device's own vibration motor" (what the strict
     * XNA `Start(TimeSpan)` targets) versus "any SDL haptic device"
     * (a broader `NOXNA` concept — see `SdlHapticVibrateBackend`'s own doc
     * comment for why, on desktop, those two currently resolve to the same
     * underlying SDL API without contradicting this distinction). Making the
     * backend swappable also lets tests inject a fake implementation
     * (`VibrateController::SetBackendForTesting()`) instead of depending on
     * whatever haptic hardware (or lack of it) happens to be present.
     *
     * `VibrateController` itself is responsible for validating/clamping
     * every parameter (duration range, intensity/magnitude clamping to
     * `[0, 1]`) before calling through this interface — implementations can
     * assume every parameter they receive is already valid and do not need
     * to re-validate or throw.
