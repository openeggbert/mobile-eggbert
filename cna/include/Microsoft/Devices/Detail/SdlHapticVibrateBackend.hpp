    /**
     * @brief `IVibrateBackend` implementation backed by SDL3's `SDL_Haptic` API (Task VIB-002).
     *
     * This is the only production `IVibrateBackend` implementation in this
     * codebase today, used on every platform (desktop and Android alike).
     * It deliberately excludes any haptic device that is also a connected
     * joystick/gamepad's own rumble motor, so it never competes with
     * `Microsoft::Xna::Framework::Input::GamePad::SetVibration()` for the
     * same physical actuator (see `IsConnectedGamepadHapticDevice()` in the
     * `.cpp`) — if the only haptic-capable device present is a game
     * controller, this backend behaves exactly as if no device were present
     * at all.
     *
     * **Why one backend currently serves both "the phone's vibration motor"
     * and "a generic desktop haptic device" (Task VIB-002's original
     * concern):** on Android, SDL3's own bundled Android haptic backend
     * (`third_party/SDL/src/haptic/android/SDL_syshaptic.c`) enumerates
     * `Context.VIBRATOR_SERVICE` — the phone's own built-in vibrator — as an
     * `SDL_Haptic` device, so `OpenFirstHapticDevice()` below reaches it with
     * no Android-specific code needed (re-confirmed by `VIB-003`). On
     * desktop, the same code instead opens whatever generic force-feedback
     * hardware SDL enumerates (e.g. a USB wheel), which is not "a phone
     * vibrating" at all — this is accepted, documented `NOXNA`-flavored
     * desktop behavior (there being no phone to vibrate on a desktop in the
     * first place), not a compatibility risk: strict XNA `Start(TimeSpan)`
     * on a real Windows Phone device has no desktop code path to begin with,
     * so nothing here can rumble a desktop gadget "as if it were the phone"
     * in a way real WP7 content could ever observe or depend on.
