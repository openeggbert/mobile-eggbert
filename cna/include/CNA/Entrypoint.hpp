/**
 * @file CNA/Entrypoint.hpp
 * @brief Include this header in the translation unit that defines main() (i.e. Program.cpp).
 *
 * On Android/SDL builds, SDL_main.h renames main() to SDL_main() via a preprocessor
 * macro so that SDL's Java bridge (SDLActivity.nativeRunMain) can locate and call it.
 * Without this rename the app exits immediately because the "SDL_main" symbol is never
 * exported from the shared library.
 *
 * On all other platforms (Windows, Linux, macOS, Emscripten) SDL_main.h is effectively
 * a no-op — it either provides an identity macro or is not included at all — so including
 * this header is safe and portable everywhere.
 *
 * Game code must include this header instead of \<SDL3/SDL_main.h\> directly so that the
 * SDL dependency stays hidden behind the CNA platform layer.
