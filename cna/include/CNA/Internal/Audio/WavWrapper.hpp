     * Builds a minimal, valid in-memory RIFF/WAVE file from raw WAVEFORMATEX fields plus a

     * (`SDL_LoadWAV_IO`, used internally by `MIX_LoadAudio_IO`) instead of the raw-PCM-only
     * `MIX_LoadRawAudio_IO` path, which only understands uncompressed `SDL_AudioFormat` values.
     *
     * SDL3's WAV loader natively decodes PCM (8/16/24/32-bit), IEEE float (32-bit), and MS/IMA
     * ADPCM (4-bit) -- this wrapper is the shared mechanism that lets CNA reach that decoder for
     * every one of those formats from both the XNB `SoundEffectReader` and XACT `WaveBank`
     * entries, without CNA needing its own ADPCM/float decoder.
     *
     * `extensionData` is copied verbatim into the "fmt " chunk after the base 16-byte
     * WAVEFORMATEX fields (as the `cbSize`-prefixed extension), exactly as it would appear in a
     * real WAV file's fmt chunk -- for MS-ADPCM/IMA-ADPCM this must contain a valid
     * `wSamplesPerBlock` (and, for MS-ADPCM, `wNumCoef` plus its coefficient table); pass an empty
     * vector for formats with no extension (PCM, IEEE float).
     *
     * `factSampleFrames`, if nonzero, is written as a "fact" chunk's `dwSampleLength` -- not
     * strictly required by SDL's non-strict WAV loading mode, but included when known since it
     * improves decode accuracy for compressed formats. Pass 0 to omit the fact chunk entirely.
