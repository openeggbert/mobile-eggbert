// plan_dx.md Phase DX12 (DX-106): explicit, deliberate per-resource D3D12_RESOURCE_STATES tracking
// -- the plan's own row calls this "the single biggest source of 'silently wrong' bugs in a first
// D3D12 backend" and requires real state tracking, not ad-hoc barrier calls scattered through draw
// code. This class is the single source of truth for "what state is this ID3D12Resource currently
// in," and the only place that emits a D3D12_RESOURCE_BARRIER transition.
//
// Deliberately standalone and resource-content-agnostic: DX-109 (actual vertex/index buffers,
// textures, render targets) hasn't landed yet, so this is proven here against any ID3D12Resource
// (a throwaway committed buffer in the smoke test is sufficient to prove the tracking logic itself
// -- see that test's own comment for why this doesn't need a real render-target pipeline).
