// plan_dx9.md Phase D9-11 (D9-110): parses the CTAB (constant table) comment Microsoft's real
// compiler embeds in compiled D3D9 shader bytecode, returning the name -> register mapping for
// every named constant. Design decision 9: this project does not link D3DX (ID3DXConstantTable's
// own home -- a deprecated d3dx9_43.dll redistributable this project will not ship), so this reads
// the documented D3DXSHADER_CONSTANTTABLE binary layout directly instead of calling that helper
// API. Needed because, unlike D3D11's own D3D11EffectBackend (a fixed-slot cbuffer convention
// works there since HLSL cbuffer field offsets are caller-predictable), D3D9 constant REGISTERS
// are assigned by the compiler itself and can vary between shaders -- a real post-compile
// name -> register lookup is the only reliable way to know where a named uniform actually landed.
//
// Token-stream layout reference (D3D9 shader bytecode): a comment token has its low 16 bits equal
// to 0xFFFE, with bits 16-30 giving the comment's payload size in DWORDs. This project's own
// compare_against_fxb.py (D9-73) already walks this exact token stream, DWORD by DWORD, to strip
// comments from 66 real compiled shaders and get an exact 61/66 byte-identical match against
// Microsoft's own shipped bytecode -- that already-proven walking strategy is mirrored here
// (advance one DWORD at a time; only comment tokens need their own length decoded, every other
// token is stepped over one DWORD at a time without needing a full instruction-length decoder).
//
// The CTAB payload itself begins with the 'CTAB' FourCC, followed by the documented
// D3DXSHADER_CONSTANTTABLE header (all offset fields relative to the 'CTAB' FourCC's own byte
// position) and a D3DXSHADER_CONSTANTINFO[] array. See D3D9ConstantTable.cpp for the exact layout
// this parser assumes -- validated empirically against real d3dcompiler_47.dll output in
// D3D9ConstantTableTests.cpp, not merely assumed from memory of the documented format.
