// plan_dx9.md Phase D9-10 (D9-100/D9-101/D9-102/D9-103): XNA 4.0's GraphicsProfile.Reach/HiDef
// capability floors, real on this backend only (the other 9 CNA backends have no D3DCAPS9 to
// query and keep their honest GraphicsAdapter::IsProfileSupported() == true; -- see plan_dx9.md's
// own "Boundaries" section). See plan_dx9.md's D9-100 closure note for the full researched table
// and its citations (FNA's own ProfileCapabilities.cs -- confirmed dead code, data-only, never
// actually consulted by FNA's own resource-creation/validation paths -- cross-checked against
// Shawn Hargreaves' official XNA team blog post, "Reach vs HiDef").
//
// GraphicsProfile ordinals below match Microsoft::Xna::Framework::Graphics::GraphicsProfile
// exactly (Reach=0, HiDef=1) -- plain int, matching this backend's own established convention
// for XNA enum interop (D3D9StateMapping.hpp).
//
// D9-105's own honest caveat, restated here (not just in plan_dx9.md) so it can't be missed by
// reading code alone: every D3DCAPS9-consuming function below is REAL logic against a REAL
// IDirect3D9/IDirect3DDevice9 -- but in this project's Wine+DXVK dev loop, the D3DCAPS9 VALUES
// those calls return are DXVK's own synthesized capability set, not what an authentic XNA-era
// (~2006-2013) Direct3D 9 driver would report. IsProfileSupported(HiDef) returning true here
// proves the comparison logic is correct, NOT that a real HiDef-class GPU exists in this loop --
// it doesn't; there is no such hardware here. Provisional until D9-140 (real Windows hardware,
// needs_human). Do not cite this dev environment's own results as proof of hardware authenticity.
