> ## Session summary (2026-07-17 → 2026-07-18) — read this first on a clean context
>
> Three large, sequential efforts landed this session, each fully merged into both
> `feature/graphics` and `develop`, pushed to `origin`:
>
> 1. **`plan_cnj.md` Phase 14 completed in full** — glTF import gaps (multi-UV-set diagnostics,
>    morph target CLI/.cnj serialization, CUBICSPLINE interpolation, DualTextureEffect occlusion
>    fix, Draco mesh compression, angle-weighted tangent generation, `KHR_texture_transform`/
>    `KHR_lights_punctual`/`KHR_materials_emissive_strength`), then **PBR (`PbrEffect`/
>    `SkinnedPbrEffect`) + `SkinnedEffect.VertexColorEnabled` ported to all 7 remaining graphics
>    backends** (Vulkan, Bgfx, SdlGpu, WebGPU unskinned-only, D3D9/D3D11/D3D12 compile-verified
>    only). See `plan_cnj.md`'s own top banner and Phases 14A–14J for full detail — this file does
>    not duplicate it.
> 2. **`plan_webgpu.md` grew substantially** — render state (blend/rasterizer/cull/wireframe/
>    scissor/viewport/sampler/depth-stencil), `RenderTarget2D`/`RenderTargetCube`, MSAA,
>    `EnvironmentMapEffect`, real instancing, `Texture3D`, `Texture2D`/`TextureCube` `GetData()`
>    readback, and real linear-filtered mip generation. **`plan_webgpu.md`'s own top banner has a
>    full, current "Remaining work" summary — read it directly, don't re-derive it here.** Only
>    genuinely open item found requiring cross-backend design work: compressed (DXT/BC) texture
>    upload needs a shared `ImageData`/`Texture2D.cpp` change, not a backend-local fix (no CNA
>    backend anywhere does real native compressed upload today).
> 3. **`plan_graphics.md` Task 863 closed** — `Texture3D`/`TextureCube` now inherit `Texture`
>    (matching FNA), closing the "cannot be sampled by any shader" architectural gap. EasyGL-only
>    implementation (`BindTexture3D`, mirroring the existing `BindTextureCube`/Task 1081 path);
>    Vulkan/Bgfx/WebGPU/SDL_Renderer/D3D9-12 are explicitly deferred follow-ups, not started.
>    **Found and logged a genuine, unrelated pre-existing bug while independently re-verifying
>    this task**: see Task 1115 below.
>
> **Operational notes worth knowing before continuing on this machine:**
> - Run test/graphics-window commands with `DISPLAY=:99` (a dedicated Xvfb display), never `:0` —
>   check `CNA_TEST_DISPLAY` in each build dir's `CMakeCache.txt` isn't stale before trusting a
>   `ctest` run; `ctest --test-dir <dir>` also changes each test's CWD, breaking fixture-relative
>   paths — run `CnaTests` directly from the repo root instead when in doubt.
> - This machine is shared with other concurrent Claude Code agents — cap build parallelism at
>   `-j4`, never `-j$(nproc)`; pause starting new heavy work at CPU Tctl ≥85°C (resume at ≤75°C,
>   but always finish in-flight work regardless of temperature); low free RAM alone isn't urgent
>   if swap still has headroom.
>
> **Remaining open items in `plan_graphics.md`** (35 `⬜` + 1 `🟨`, as of 2026-07-18 — re-grep
> `plan_graphics.md` for `⬜|🟨` to confirm this hasn't drifted before trusting it blindly):
>
> **New, found this session, no architecture decision needed:**
> - **Task 1115** — `EasyGL_AvatarRenderer_TintRouting`/`cna_test_avatar_tint_routing` fails with
>   an almost-exact "2x expected brightness, then clamped to 255" pixel pattern — a real, specific,
>   currently-unexplained defect (probably some tint/color value applied twice in
>   `AvatarRenderer`'s real tint path), NOT the same bug Task 908 already fixed (that one was "no
>   rendered content at all" from CCW culling). Confirmed pre-existing and unrelated to anything
>   from this session (reproduces byte-identically before/after Task 863's merge). Not
>   investigated further — needs its own dedicated task to trace where the doubling happens.
>
> **Real bugs on specific backends (each independently scoped, no architecture decision needed):**
> - **869** — `GraphicsDevice` state properties (`BlendState`/`DepthStencilState`/`RasterizerState`)
>   use value semantics instead of FNA's reference semantics.
> - **872** — `GraphicsDevice.ReferenceStencil` isn't a real, independent, backend-connected
>   override (Task 319 finding).
> - **890** — `EnvironmentMapEffect` doesn't forward `DirectionalLight1`/`DirectionalLight2` on any
>   of the 3 backends.
> - **893** — `SkinnedEffect` doesn't forward `DirectionalLight1`/`DirectionalLight2` either.
> - **894** — `SkinnedEffect` has no real specular highlights.
> - **895** — `SkinnedEffect.WeightsPerVertex` is a complete GPU no-op on all 3 backends.
> - **933** — EasyGL: a full-backbuffer `SpriteBatch` draw before any 3D draw in the same frame
>   breaks that frame's 3D rendering entirely (see `DEFERRED.md`).
> - **952** — Bgfx: `RenderTargetCube`'s depth buffer doesn't gate face draws (surfaced fixing
>   Task 951's `Bgfx_RenderTargetCube_DepthFormat` crash).
> - **917** — Bgfx occlusion queries can't measure true scene-depth visibility (shares a view/depth
>   buffer with other submitted geometry).
> - **1113** — `GraphicsDevice::Clear(ClearOptions, ...)` masks `DepthBuffer`/`Stencil` out of the
>   request incorrectly depending on the active target's depth-stencil support.
> - **1114** — Bgfx: `SetDepthTestEnabled`/`SetBlendEnabled`/`SetDepthWriteEnabled` unconditionally
>   throw via `ThrowNo3DState()` in cases where they shouldn't.
>
> **Large, standalone sub-project (10 tasks, not a quick pick-up):**
> - **10200–10209** — MojoShader: vendor `third_party/mojoshader`, a C++ wrapper around
>   `mojoshader_effects.c`'s parser (compiled `.fxb` → technique/pass/parameter reflection), then
>   wire it through EasyGL (GLSL)/Vulkan (needs a vendored GLSL→SPIR-V compiler, `10203`
>   feasibility not yet decided)/Bgfx (needs its own `shaderc` investigation, `10205`), plus
>   `Effect::Clone()` (folds in Task 883's `EffectPass::owner_` re-binding hazard), real compiled
>   test fixtures, and docs. This is a full compiled-XNA-effect-bytecode feature, comparable in
>   scope to a phase of its own.
>
> **Verification/content tasks (need real test assets, not just code):**
> - **938/943/944** — skinned-model verification via `Content.Load<Model>` (SplitScreen,
>   SkinningSample) and a real FBX/X skeletal-animation → CNA-schema conversion tool.
> - **474/475/477/478** — DEFERRED, generate reference values for `BasicEffect` defaults/lighting
>   constants and `SpriteFont.MeasureString`, plus reference screenshots for SpriteBatch/BasicEffect
>   — all share the same documented prerequisite blocker (see each row for detail).
>
> **Infrastructure / lower-priority:**
> - **919** — wire the `GraphicsSmoke` CTest label into real CI (e.g. a
>   `.github/workflows/graphics-smoke-ci.yml`).
> - **920** — 2 Android-NDK build regressions in the sibling `sharp-runtime` repo blocking the
>   entire CNA/Android cross-compile.
> - **1108** — Software backend: real per-vertex-lit CPU rasterizer path.
> - **1109** (🟨) — regenerate/update every existing lit-scene pixel-test baseline across all
>   touched backends once their own dispatch honors the real default.
> - **1110** — decide scope: which `SurfaceFormat` values justify oracle coverage, and whether
>   `Texture2D` needs new construction/`SetData` paths for them.

# NEXT.md — CNA Project Handoff (`feature/dx9` branch — Direct3D 9 backend only)

> **This `NEXT.md` is scoped to the D3D9 backend only, per explicit project-owner instruction
> (2026-07-14).** This branch (`feature/dx9`, worktree `cnadx9`) is a parallel effort to the
> established EasyGL/Vulkan/Bgfx/SDL_Renderer/WebGPU/Headless/Software/D3D11/D3D12 backends, all of
> which are developed on other branches (`develop` and friends) and are **not tracked here**. For
> their status, see `plan_graphics.md`, `plan_dx.md`, `plan_webgpu.md`, `plan_software.md`,
> `plan_headless.md`, and `git log` on those branches — this file will not duplicate it, and will
> not be updated for non-D3D9 work. Full D3D9 task-by-task detail and history lives in
> **`plan_dx9.md`** (`D9-0`–`D9-140`); this file is a short current-state index, the same relationship
> `plan_dx.md`/`NEXT.md` had for D3D11/D3D12 before this branch existed.
>
> **Status (2026-07-14): implementation authorized, Phase D9-0 spikes closed, no backend code written
> yet.** The project owner has authorized implementation through Phase D9-13 (`plan_dx9.md`'s own
> "Boundaries" still require asking before Phase D9-11 "custom `ShaderEffect`"; Phase D9-14 needs real
> Windows hardware and is `needs_human`). The plan's one architectural blocker — the
> `IGraphicsBackend`/`GraphicsBackendCreateArgs` boundary problem — is also resolved: an additive
> extension (new optional presentation-parameter fields + a narrow device-event notification channel)
> is approved, unblocking `D9-30`/`D9-32`/`D9-33`/`D9-34`. See `plan_dx9.md`'s top banner and "The
> `IGraphicsBackend` boundary problem" section for the full record.

> **Separate, unrelated track — `plan_graphics.md` Phase 78 (DEFERRED.md item #11, HLSL→GLSL sample
> shader conversion) is now FULLY COMPLETE, as of 2026-07-16 (EasyGL only).** This is completely
> independent of the D3D work above — it unblocks samples catalogued in `plan_samples.md`
> (`../cna-samples`' own 153-sample re-audit), not `plan_dx.md`. **Task 945 decided** (project
> owner, 2026-07-16): manual line-by-line HLSL→GLSL porting, no `SPIRV-Cross`/`dxc` pipeline — every
> HLSL construct hit across every shader ported turned out to be a mechanical 1:1 substitution.
> **Task 947 is now 13/13 — every sample originally blocked purely by DEFERRED.md #11 has its
> shader(s) ported and pixel-verified**: `NetRumble`, `PerPixelLighting`, `VertexLighting`,
> `DistortionSample`, `NonPhotoRealistic`, `ShadowMapping`, `NormalMapping`, `BillboardSample`,
> `ShatterEffect`, `Particles3D`, `XmlParticles`, `ShipGame`, `InstancedModel` (`BloomSample`, the
> 14th sample under the same DEFERRED.md #11 umbrella, was already closed earlier via Task 946).
> Along the way, 4 new backend capabilities were added and closed, all EasyGL-only, all additive
> (Vulkan/Bgfx/SDL_Renderer untouched): **Task 1079** (wires `ShaderEffect` into `GraphicsDevice`'s
> 3D draw path, not just `SpriteBatch`), **Task 1080** (genuinely custom vertex layouts for that
> path, not just the 5 fixed byte-strides), **Task 1081** (`TextureCube` sampling for custom
> shaders), **Task 1082** (real GPU hardware instancing — `glVertexAttribDivisor`-driven per-instance
> vertex streams). **What remains is explicitly NOT `cna_graphics` scope**: the actual sample ports
> (`.cpp`/`.hpp`/`Content/` under `../cna-samples/samples/<Name>/`) for these 13 (now-unblocked)
> samples still need to be written in the sibling `../cna-samples` repo, tracked in that repo's own
> plan file, not here or in `plan_graphics.md`/`plan_samples.md`. `plan_samples.md` also still has
> ~88 other `⬜` rows unrelated to this shader-conversion track (re-verification passes, other
> DEFERRED.md items, etc.) — untouched by this work, standing backlog. Full detail: `plan_graphics.md`
> Task 947's own row (chronological per-shader history, discriminating-power mutation testing for
> every one) and Tasks 1079–1082's own rows; `plan_samples.md` for the per-sample CNA-gap tracking.

> **Separate, unrelated track — `feature/input` branch, `audit_input.md` remediation + full

> not duplicated here. **Status: this plan is now CLOSED as of 2026-07-17** — Phases 0-10, 12, and 13

## 1. Project summary

**CNA** is a C++23 reimplementation of the XNA 4.0 programming model
(`Microsoft::Xna::Framework`), built on SDL3 with a pluggable graphics backend layer. This branch
adds a **Direct3D 9** backend — see `plan_dx9.md` for the full plan. Unlike every other CNA backend,
this one is not a coverage/parity effort: its stated goal (set by the project owner) is that a CNA
game running on D3D9 be **indistinguishable** from the same game running on the original XNA 4.0
runtime, verified against a real XNA 4.0 oracle running under Wine (Phase D9-A), not just "renders
plausibly."

- **Key decisions already made** (see `plan_dx9.md` design decisions 1–17 for the full rationale):
  - Plain `Direct3DCreate9`, **not** D3D9Ex — `D3DPOOL_MANAGED` for user resources so they survive
    `Reset()`, and the real XNA device-lost lifecycle (`DeviceLost`/`DeviceResetting`/`DeviceReset`)
    is implemented for real, for the first time in this project.
  - Microsoft's own XNA 4.0 Stock Effects HLSL (`BasicEffect.fx` and 5 siblings, from the FNA tree)
    are **vendored verbatim** and compiled by CNA itself (`D3DCompile`, `vs_2_0`/`ps_2_0`) — not
    reimplemented, not ported. The `.fxb` shipped bytecode is a verification oracle only.
  - `D3DCommon` (shared with D3D11/D3D12) is **not** expanded — D3D9 gets its own
    `D3D9FormatMapping`/`D3D9StateMapping`/`D3D9VertexDeclarations`.
  - Render state, not state objects (`SetRenderState`/`SetSamplerState` sequences — no D3D9 state
    objects exist to cache).
  - This is the **only** CNA backend that can natively answer `GraphicsAdapter::IsProfileSupported()`
    for real (`D3DCAPS9`) — Phase D9-10.
- **A cross-cutting finding, not this plan's to fix**: taking XNA seriously as the spec surfaced six
  confirmed CNA-vs-XNA divergences that exist on **every** CNA backend today (worst: CNA always
  lights per-pixel; XNA's default is per-vertex, and CNA has no per-vertex lighting shader anywhere).
  This plan measures and reports them (Phase D9-A6, `D9-81`); it does **not** fix them — that is a
  `plan_graphics.md`-level, project-owner decision. See `plan_dx9.md`'s "CNA's divergences from XNA
  4.0" section before touching any of this.

## 2. Current status

### Build status

| Build dir | Backend | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `cmake-build-d3d9` | D3D9 (Windows cross-compile, MinGW-w64) | **Verified clean 2026-07-15**: `cmake -DCNA_GRAPHICS_BACKEND=D3D9 -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=cmake/toolchains/mingw-w64.cmake -DCNA_BUILD_TESTS=ON` configures; `CNA`/`cna_backend_graphics_d3d9` and all 11 D3D9 test binaries build clean. `D3D9_Common` 29/29 + `D3D9_ShaderDispatch` 23/23 + `D3D9_Smoke` 55/55 + `D3D9_Draw` 3/3 + `D3D9_DrawEx` 17/17 + `D3D9_ShaderCache` 6/6 + `D3D9_Instanced` 4/4 + `D3D9_BlendState_Opaque`/`D3D9_BlendState_AlphaBlend`/`D3D9_DepthStencilState_StencilEnable`/`D3D9_RasterizerState_CullMode` (1 check each, reused EasyGL sources) all pass via `ctest --test-dir cmake-build-d3d9 -L D3D9` (11 CTests). A real device now creates, clears, presents, reads back pixels, resizes, recovers from a (simulated) device-lost event, round-trips real vertex/index buffer data, round-trips real 2D/cube/volume texture data (including a genuinely non-power-of-two texture), creates/binds/clears/reads back real 2D/cube/MSAA render targets, binds a real 2-target MRT set, runs a real occlusion query, applies real sampler state, creates all 66 real Microsoft stock-effect shaders through a live device, correctly replicates XNA's own shader-permutation selection logic for all 5 effects, draws its first real 3D triangle (`DrawColoredPrimitives`/`DrawIndexedColoredPrimitives`), draws real effect-aware geometry for **all 5 XNA Stock Effects** (`BasicEffect`/`AlphaTestEffect`/`DualTextureEffect`/`EnvironmentMapEffect`/`SkinnedEffect` via `DrawPrimitivesEx`/`DrawIndexedPrimitivesEx` — textured, vertex-color, multi-light and one-light vertex-lit, fog, alpha-test clip pass/fail, two-sampler doubling-blend, cube-map env-map blend, per-vertex bone-matrix skinning, all pixel-exact against hand-computed expected colors), draws real hardware-instanced geometry (`DrawInstancedPrimitivesEx` via `SetStreamSourceFreq`, CNA's own NOXNA instancing shader, two genuinely distinct per-instance transforms proven pixel-exact in one draw call), genuinely toggles the depth test/write via `SetDepthTestEnabled`/`SetDepthWriteEnabled` (a real 2026-07-15 bug fix, proven by a near/far occlusion discriminator), and reuses the same backend-agnostic EasyGL blend/depth-stencil/rasterizer-state pixel tests D3D11/Vulkan already share, all through the actual public `Game`/`GraphicsDeviceManager`/`GraphicsDevice` API (or, for the shader cache/dispatch, the backend's own real device handle or pure functions). |

### Phase D9-0 — feasibility spikes: CLOSED 2026-07-14

| Task | Status |
|---|---|
| `D9-1` — real Microsoft `d3dcompiler_47.dll` compiles all 66/66 stock-effect entry points | ✅ |
| `D9-73` — 61/66 byte-identical to Microsoft's shipped `.fxb`; decision made (CNA compiles its own) | 🟨 (decided; 5 `PixelLighting` variants still need oracle-proof, `D9-73`'s own obligation) |
| `D9-A1`/`D9-A2` — real XNA 4.0 runs under Wine and renders a verified `CornflowerBlue` triangle | ✅ |
| `D9-2` — confirm minimum link set (`d3d9` alone, no `dxguid`) | ✅ |
| `D9-3` — Wine+DXVK D3D9 loop end-to-end: exact pixel round-trip + full `D3DCAPS9` dump | ✅ |
| `D9-4` — `D3DPOOL_MANAGED` genuinely `LockRect`-readable and survives `Reset()` intact | ✅ |
| `D9-5` — `scripts/run-wine-dxvk9.sh` (new script, DXVK-marker gate, positive+negative proven) | ✅ |

**Phase D9-0 is fully closed.** Next up: Phase D9-1 (CMake integration + backend skeleton).

### Phase D9-A — the XNA 4.0 oracle: D9-A1–A4 closed, D9-A5 started (31 scenes, all 5 Stock Effects + fog + all 8 AlphaTestEffect.AlphaFunction values (COMPLETE) + EnvironmentMapEffect fresnel + SkinnedEffect all 3 WeightsPerVertex values (COMPLETE) + SpriteBatch core draw path + address modes + 3 of 5 SpriteSortMode values + multi-texture batching + ALL 4 PrimitiveType values (COMPLETE)), D9-A6 CLOSED 2026-07-16 (EasyGL measured: 10/31 pixel-perfect, 21/31 diverge — see `docs/d3d9-divergence-report.md`)

| Task | Status |
|---|---|
| `D9-A1` — stand up real XNA 4.0 under Wine | ✅ |
| `D9-A2` — minimal XNA 4.0 reference app, no content pipeline | ✅ |
| `D9-A3` — byte-for-byte equivalent CNA app, shared declarative scene format | ✅ |
| `D9-A4` — `scripts/xna-diff.py`, DXVK-into-XNA-prefix prerequisite | ✅ |
| `D9-A5` — growing scene corpus | 🟨 (31 scenes, all 5 XNA Stock Effects + `IEffectFog` + ALL 8 `AlphaTestEffect.AlphaFunction` values (`Less`/`LessEqual`/`GreaterEqual`/`Greater`/`Never`/`Always` on `PSAlphaTestLtGt`, `Equal`/`NotEqual` on `PSAlphaTestEqNe` — `AlphaTestEffect` compare-function coverage COMPLETE) + `EnvironmentMapEffect.FresnelFactor` + `SkinnedEffect` ALL 3 `WeightsPerVertex` values (`1`/`2`/`4` — `SkinnedEffect` weighting coverage COMPLETE) + `SpriteBatch` core draw path, address modes, 3 of 5 `SpriteSortMode` values, and multi-texture `FlushBatch()`-on-texture-change batching (`D9-90`/`D9-91`/`D9-92`/`D9-93` all CLOSED; `D9-93` covers `Deferred`/`BackToFront`/`FrontToBack`, `Immediate`/`Texture` explicitly scoped out — see `plan_dx9.md` D9-93's own closure note) + ALL 4 `PrimitiveType` values (`TriangleList`/`TriangleStrip`/`LineList`/`LineStrip` — `PrimitiveType` coverage COMPLETE) represented: `colored3d`, `textured_quad`, `lit_textured_quad`, `alphatest_quad`, `alphatest_less_quad`, `alphatest_equal_quad`, `alphatest_notequal_quad`, `alphatest_greaterequal_quad`, `alphatest_lessequal_quad`, `alphatest_never_quad`, `alphatest_always_quad`, `dualtexture_quad`, `envmap_quad`, `envmap_fresnel_quad`, `skinned_quad`, `skinned_twobone_quad`, `skinned_fourbone_quad`, `multilight_textured_quad`, `fog_gradient_quad`, `sprite_basic_quad`, `sprite_rotated_quad`, `sprite_flipped_quad`, `sprite_wrap_quad`, `sprite_mirror_quad`, `sprite_sortmode_deferred_quad`, `sprite_sortmode_backtofront_quad`, `sprite_sortmode_fronttoback_quad`, `sprite_multitexture_quad`, `colored_trianglestrip_quad`, `colored_linelist_quad`, `colored_linestrip_quad`, all pixel-perfect) |
| `D9-A6` — run the corpus against CNA's other backends too | ✅ (EasyGL: 10/31 pixel-perfect, 21/31 diverge; Vulkan/D3D11 not yet measured) |

Closed 2026-07-15 (`D9-A3`/`D9-A4`): built the shared declarative scene format `D9-A3`'s own text
demanded (`tools/xna-oracle/scenes/*.scene`, minimal `key=value` text, no JSON library needed
since the XNA-side build environment is GAC-only .NET 4.0 with no NuGet), parsed identically by
both a rewritten, scene-driven `tools/xna-oracle/Oracle.cs` (moved from `dx9-spike/xna-oracle/`)
and a new `tools/xna-oracle/CnaOracleRender.cpp` (built via CNA's real public `Game`/
`GraphicsDeviceManager`/`GraphicsDevice`/`BasicEffect` API, `cna_oracle_render` CMake target, not
a CTest — no pass/fail of its own). Installed DXVK into the XNA oracle's own Wine prefix
(`~/.wine-cna-xna40`, `dxvk-setup install`, 32-bit `dxvk-wine32`) — `D9-A4`'s own critical
prerequisite, confirmed by the adapter string flipping from WineD3D's spoofed `ATI Radeon HD 5600
Series` to the real `AMD Radeon 780M (RADV PHOENIX)`, so both sides now execute through the same
DXVK D3D9→Vulkan path. New `scripts/xna-diff.py` (needs Pillow), `--tolerance` defaults to `0`,
mutation-verified (a 1-off-mutated PNG correctly fails at tolerance 0, correctly passes at
tolerance 1).

**Result: both oracle comparisons landed so far are pixel-perfect.** `colored3d` (`D9-A2`'s own
original triangle) and `textured_quad` (new: `BasicEffect.TextureEnabled=true`, a tiny 2×2
point-filtered checkerboard) each render **byte-identical** on both sides — `0/65536` pixels
differ, max per-channel delta `0`, confirmed by full sweeps not just spot checks (including the
exact UV=(0.5,0.5) point-filter texel-boundary pixel for `textured_quad` — both sides independently
pick the identical texel there). Extended the scene format to a second vertex shape
(`vertexformat=PositionColor`/`PositionTexture`) and inline procedural texture data on both sides
for `textured_quad`. **Real bug found and fixed while writing it, in `Oracle.cs` itself**: the
original `ParseBool` used a C# 6 expression-bodied member (`=> s == "true";"`), which the real
in-prefix `csc.exe` (.NET Framework 4.0-era, pre-C#-6) rejected outright (`CS1002`/`CS1519`) —
meaning `D9-A3`'s own original "pixel-perfect" claim had never actually been verified against the
rewritten, scene-driven `Oracle.cs`, only against the old hardcoded `dx9-spike` spike. Fixed
(ordinary block-bodied method), recompiled, re-ran `colored3d` through the real current `Oracle.cs`
and reconfirmed `0/65536` — closing that verification gap. This is the first evidence this
backend's `BasicEffect` TEXTURED dispatch is also genuinely indistinguishable from real XNA 4.0.
`D9-A5`'s corpus now has 3 scenes, by design ("growing with the plan," not attempted all at once)
— see `tools/xna-oracle/README.md`.

**3rd scene, `lit_textured_quad` (2026-07-15) — also pixel-perfect.** Extended the scene format
again to a third vertex shape (`vertexformat=PositionNormalTexture`, matching `VSInputNmTx`'s
Position+Normal+TexCoord shape and the existing stride-32 CNA vertex layout) plus
`ambientcolor`/`light0enabled`/`light0diffuse`/`light0direction` keys wired to
`BasicEffect.AmbientLightColor`/`DirectionalLight0` on both sides. Deliberately dimmed the light
(`diffuse=0.5`, no ambient) rather than a bright one — a first draft saturated to full intensity,
making the lit result indistinguishable from the raw texture and proving nothing about whether the
lighting math is genuinely applied; the dimmed version visibly halves the texture color
(`(255,0,0)`→`(128,0,0)`) and still matches real XNA exactly, `0/65536` pixels differ. First
evidence this backend's lit+textured `BasicEffect` dispatch (`D9-82b`'s own "lit+textured" checks,
previously only hand-verified against a hand-computed expected pixel) is genuinely
indistinguishable from real XNA 4.0.

**4th scene, `alphatest_quad` (2026-07-15) — also pixel-perfect, first non-`BasicEffect` Stock
Effect in the corpus.** Added `effect=BasicEffect`/`AlphaTestEffect` plus `alphafunction`/
`referencealpha` keys wired to `AlphaTestEffect.AlphaFunction`/`ReferenceAlpha`, reusing the
existing `PositionTexture` vertex shape. A 2×2 texture whose 4 texels straddle
`ReferenceAlpha=128` (alpha `255`/`0`/`255`/`64`, `AlphaFunction=Greater`) exercises `clip()`'s
real discard end to end — passing texels show their own color, failing texels show the clear
color through the discard, `0/65536` pixels differ.

**Real bug found and fixed live in `CnaOracleRender.cpp`, a dangling-pointer bug, not a backend
bug.** `GraphicsDevice::DrawUserPrimitives()` reads `GpuDrawParams` from `currentEffect_`, a raw
pointer `Effect::Apply()` sets. Adding the second effect type scoped the constructed
`BasicEffect`/`AlphaTestEffect` inside an `if`/`else` block, destroying it at the closing brace —
before the shared `DrawUserPrimitives()` call further down read the now-dangling pointer. Symptom:
`textured_quad`/`lit_textured_quad` (both previously passing, unrelated to this change) started
throwing with flags matching NEITHER scene's actual settings (stale stack memory); `colored3d`
happened to still pass by pure allocation-timing luck, not correctness. Fixed by declaring both
possible effect objects as `std::unique_ptr` at `Draw()`'s own top level so whichever gets
constructed survives every draw call in the function; re-verified all 4 scenes pixel-perfect
afterward. `Oracle.cs`'s own `Effect fx;` was never at risk (C# is GC-managed, not scope-based).

**5th scene, `dualtexture_quad` (2026-07-15) — also pixel-perfect, 2nd non-`BasicEffect` Stock
Effect, and the first scene needing a vertex shape NEITHER side had a built-in type for.** Added
`effect=DualTextureEffect` plus `texture2*`/`diffusecolor` keys, and a new
`vertexformat=PositionDualTexture` (Position+TexCoord0+TexCoord1, stride 28, `VSInputTx2`). Real
XNA has no built-in dual-UV vertex struct either, so both sides define their own custom
`IVertexType`/`VertexDeclaration` — exactly what a real game using `DualTextureEffect` has to do.
Two 1×1 solid-color textures (white, `(100,60,20)`) + `DiffuseColor=(0.5,0.5,0.5)`: the real
doubling-blend formula (`texture0 * texture1 * 2 * DiffuseColor`) makes the `*2*0.5` cancel out, so
the expected result is exactly `(100,60,20,255)` — hand-derived *before* running either side,
matching `D9-82d`'s own already-proven check value, then confirmed pixel-for-pixel, `0/65536`
differ. Added as a third `std::unique_ptr` alongside `alphaFx`/`basicFx`, correctly avoiding a
repeat of `alphatest_quad`'s own dangling-pointer bug — no new bug this time.

**6th scene, `envmap_quad` (2026-07-15) — also pixel-perfect, 3rd non-`BasicEffect` Stock Effect,
and a real API-surface finding (not a bug) this time.** Added `effect=EnvironmentMapEffect` plus
`environmentmap*` keys, reusing the existing `PositionNormalTexture` shape (no new vertex format
needed — `D9-82e`'s own finding). 1×1 base texture + 1×1 `TextureCube` (all 6 faces the same
color, `D9-82e`'s own `reflect()`-geometry-sidestep trick) + one dim light,
`EnvironmentMapAmount=0.5`: real formula `lerp(texture*diffuseSum, environmentMap,
environmentMapAmount)` produced exact `(164,114,89,255)` on both sides, `0/65536` differ.

**Real finding: real XNA/FNA's `EnvironmentMapEffect` implements `IEffectLights.LightingEnabled`
via explicit interface implementation** — invisible on the concrete class's public C# surface
(confirmed live: `emfx.LightingEnabled = ...` is a genuine `CS1061` against the real `csc.exe`;
FNA's own source: `set { if (!value) throw new NotSupportedException(...); }` — lighting is always
on, no game can disable it). CNA's own `setLightingEnabledProperty` already matches this exact
behavior faithfully (getter always `true`, setter throws given `false`) — only the *visibility*
differs (C++ has no explicit-interface-implementation hiding), not the behavior. Neither side
calls it for this effect now, matching what a real game actually can do.

**7th scene, `skinned_quad` (2026-07-15) — also pixel-perfect. MILESTONE: every one of XNA's 5
Stock Effects is now represented in the corpus, all pixel-perfect.** Added `effect=SkinnedEffect`
plus a fourth custom vertex shape (`vertexformat=PositionNormalTextureWeights`, stride 52,
`VSInputNmTxWeights`, matches the existing stride-52 layout byte-for-byte — no new CNA vertex
declaration needed, `D9-82f`'s own finding). Real XNA has no built-in skinned vertex struct either
(same category as `DualTextureEffect`'s dual-UV gap), so both sides define their own custom type.
Deliberately uses a single Identity bone at 100% vertex weight (`SetBoneTransforms(new[]
{Matrix.Identity})`, hardcoded, not yet scene-configurable) — the same simplification `D9-82f`'s
own CTest used: skinning is a mathematical no-op, so the expected math reduces to
`lit_textured_quad.scene`'s own already-established formula, while still genuinely exercising the
real per-vertex `BLENDWEIGHT0`/`BLENDINDICES0` upload end to end. Exact `(128,128,128,255)` on
both sides, `0/65536` differ. Same `LightingEnabled` explicit-interface-implementation carve-out
found for `SkinnedEffect` too (confirmed against FNA's own source) — not a new bug, a confirmation
the same real-XNA quirk applies to both of this project's `IEffectLights`-but-always-on effects.

**Also fixed proactively**: added `[StructLayout(LayoutKind.Sequential)]` to both
`VertexPositionDualTexture` (retroactively) and the new `VertexPositionNormalTextureWeights` on
the C# side — C#'s default "auto" struct layout does not formally guarantee field-declaration
order is preserved in memory, which `DrawUserPrimitives<T>`'s raw-byte marshalling against an
explicit-offset `VertexDeclaration` silently depends on. `VertexPositionDualTexture` had been
relying on this working out in practice (all-`Vector2`/`Vector3` fields); the newly-mixed
float+byte struct was a genuinely higher-risk case to leave unpinned. All 7 scenes re-verified
pixel-perfect afterward, not just the new one.

**8th scene, `multilight_textured_quad` (2026-07-15) — also pixel-perfect, first scene to
genuinely exercise `BasicEffect`'s multi-light SUMMATION formula.** `D9-82b`'s own "2-light-sum"
`ShaderIndex` bucket is a structurally different dispatch path from the "`OneLight`" bucket every
earlier lit scene exercises — two active lights (`DirectionalLight0` diffuse `0.3`,
`DirectionalLight1` diffuse `0.2`, same direction) sum to the exact same total dimming
`lit_textured_quad.scene`'s own single `0.5` light already produces, matching that scene's own
`(128,128,128,255)` byte-for-byte — proving the two lights are genuinely summed, not one silently
overwriting the other's constant register. `DirectionalLight2` is present but explicitly disabled
with a large nonzero diffuse (`0.9`) that must NOT contribute — confirmed it doesn't. Extended
`light1*`/`light2*` scene keys, applied uniformly to all three lit effects
(`BasicEffect`/`EnvironmentMapEffect`/`SkinnedEffect`). All 8 scenes re-verified pixel-perfect
afterward.

**9th scene, `fog_gradient_quad` (2026-07-15) — also pixel-perfect, first scene to exercise
`IEffectFog` (`FogEnabled`/`FogColor`/`FogStart`/`FogEnd`), shared by all 5 Stock Effects.** Fog
wiring added to all five effect-construction branches on both sides (`atfx`/`dtfx`/`emfx`/`skfx`/
`bfx` in `Oracle.cs`; `alphaFx`/`dualFx`/`envMapFx`/`skinnedFx`/`basicFx` in
`CnaOracleRender.cpp`), even though this scene itself only exercises `BasicEffect` — same
"wire to every effect that has it, exercise from one scene" discipline scene 8 already used for
`light1*`/`light2*`.

**Required two false starts before a genuinely correct, non-trivial gradient rendered identically
on both sides — a real finding about FogStart/FogEnd sign conventions, confirmed against FNA's own
`EffectHelpers.SetFogVector` and `Common.fxh`'s `ComputeFogFactor` (`saturate(dot(position,
FogVector))`).** With `World=View=Identity`: `fogVector.Z = worldView.M33*scale`,
`fogVector.W = fogStart*scale`, `scale = 1/(fogStart-fogEnd)`, so
`fogFactor = saturate(z*scale + fogStart*scale)`.
- **1st draft**: vertex `z=0`(near)→`z=1`(far), `FogStart=0`/`FogEnd=1` (the "obvious" reading) →
  `scale=-1` → `fogFactor=saturate(-z)`, which is `<=0` for all `z>=0` — every pixel clamps to 0%
  fog. Rendered **uniformly white** on **both** real XNA and CNA: an exact `0/65536` match that
  proved nothing, since fog was never actually applied on either side. Caught only by sampling
  interior pixels and noticing no gradient existed — the diff tool itself cannot detect "both
  sides agree but the feature isn't exercised."
- **2nd draft**: flipped far vertices to `z=-1` for a genuinely negative view-space Z (XNA's
  "camera looks down -Z" convention). Instead pushed the primitive outside D3D's valid
  post-projection depth range `[0,w]` (`Projection` is also `Identity` here, so clip-space z **is**
  the vertex z) — near-plane-clipped away entirely on **both** sides, rendering only clear color.
  Also an exact match, also proving nothing.
- **Working fix**: keep vertex z in the safe `[0,1]` range and solve for the `FogStart`/`FogEnd`
  pair giving `fogFactor=0` at `z=0`, `fogFactor=1` at `z=1`: `FogStart=0`, `FogEnd=-1`
  (**negative**) → `scale=1` → `fogFactor=z` directly. Produced a genuine monotonic white→grey→
  black gradient (`(249,249,249)` near → `(127,127,127)` center → `(8,8,8)` far, sampled on the
  real-XNA side) — confirmed **pixel-for-pixel identical** on CNA, `0/65536` differ. First evidence
  this backend's fog dispatch is genuinely indistinguishable from real XNA 4.0, with an actual
  varying gradient proving per-pixel computation rather than a saturated constant.

All 9 scenes re-verified pixel-perfect afterward (not just the new one); full `D3D9` CTest suite
re-run, 11/11 still green.

**10th scene, `alphatest_less_quad` (2026-07-15) — also pixel-perfect, first scene to exercise a
SECOND `AlphaTestEffect.AlphaFunction` value (`Less`), not just the single `Greater` value
`alphatest_quad.scene` covers.** Reuses the same 2×2 texture and `ReferenceAlpha=128` threshold,
only `AlphaFunction` changes — deliberately **flips** which texels pass vs. get discarded relative
to the `Greater` scene, proving the compare function itself is genuinely honored (a backend that
silently ignored `AlphaFunction` would still pass `alphatest_quad.scene` but fail this one). No
code changes needed on either side — `Less` was already a supported `CompareFunction` value in
both parsers.

**Real finding — a PNG-encoder quirk in the oracle tooling itself, not a rendering bug.** A first
draft used a texel with `alpha=0` for the passing top-right texel. The actual shader OUTPUT was
byte-identical on both sides (`RGBA=(255,255,255,0)`), yet the SAVED PNG differed: real XNA's
`Texture2D.SaveAsPng` wrote `RGB=(0,0,0)` for that exact-`alpha=0` pixel, while CNA's own PNG
writer preserved the raw `RGB=(255,255,255)` — confirmed specific to `alpha==0` (not a general
premultiply-before-encode behavior) because the adjacent `alpha=64` texel matched byte-for-byte on
both sides in the same run. Fixed by changing that texel's alpha from `0` to `1` (still exercises
the identical `Less` code path, sidesteps the encoder's fully-transparent-pixel edge case) —
re-verified `0/65536` differ. All 10 scenes re-verified pixel-perfect afterward; full `D3D9` CTest
suite re-run, 11/11 still green.

**11th scene, `alphatest_equal_quad` (2026-07-15) — also pixel-perfect, first scene to exercise
`AlphaFunction=Equal`, a STRUCTURALLY different pixel shader bucket from `Greater`/`Less`.**
Confirmed against FNA's own `AlphaTestEffect.cs` source: `Less`/`LessEqual`/`GreaterEqual`/
`Greater`/`Never`/`Always` all compile to the shared `PSAlphaTestLtGt` shader
(`clip((a < x) ? z : w)`), while `Equal`/`NotEqual` compile to the entirely separate
`PSAlphaTestEqNe` shader (`clip((abs(a - x) < y) ? z : w)`) — genuinely different comparison
logic. FNA's source also gives the exact tolerance: `threshold = 0.5f / 255f` (half of one 8-bit
integer step). The scene straddles that boundary with 4 texels: `alpha=128` (exact match to
`ReferenceAlpha=128`, PASSES), `alpha=127`/`alpha=129` (off by `1/255`, both FAIL), `alpha=1` (far
off, FAILS) — the pass/fail pattern was predicted before running either side, then confirmed
pixel-for-pixel identical, `0/65536` differ. No code changes needed (`Equal` was already
supported). All 11 scenes re-verified pixel-perfect afterward; full `D3D9` CTest suite re-run,
11/11 still green.

**12th scene, `envmap_fresnel_quad` (2026-07-15) — also pixel-perfect, first scene to genuinely
exercise `EnvironmentMapEffect.FresnelFactor` with a real per-vertex gradient. Also fixed a real
documentation-accuracy gap in `envmap_quad.scene` itself (not a rendering bug).** New
`fresnelfactor` scene key wired on both sides. **Real finding**: `envmap_quad.scene`'s own comment
claimed to test the "non-fresnel bucket", but neither side had ever actually set `FresnelFactor`
for it, and real XNA's `EnvironmentMapEffect` constructor defaults `FresnelFactor=1` (confirmed in
FNA's source, matched by CNA's own constructor) — meaning that scene had ACTUALLY been running the
fresnel-ENABLED bucket the whole time. Undetected because the geometry is coincidentally
degenerate for Fresnel: the quad sits in the same `z=0` plane as `EyePosition=(0,0,0)` (`View` is
always `Identity`), so `viewAngle=dot(eyeVector,normal)=0` at every vertex with `normal=(0,0,1)`,
and `pow(max(1-abs(0),0), anything)=1` regardless of the Fresnel exponent — enabled and disabled
Fresnel produce the IDENTICAL result for that geometry. Fixed with an explicit `fresnelfactor=0`;
re-verified `0/65536` differ, unchanged.

The new scene proves the real formula (`pow(max(1-abs(dot(eyeVector,worldNormal)),0),
FresnelFactor) * EnvironmentMapAmount`, computed per-vertex then Gouraud-interpolated). A second
trap surfaced designing it: any single normal shared by all 4 corners of this symmetric
origin-centered quad gives an IDENTICAL fresnelFactor everywhere (no gradient) — fixed by
deliberately assigning DIFFERENT per-vertex normals to the top vs. bottom edge (`(0,0,1)` top →
`fresnelFactor=1` exactly; `(1,0,0)` bottom → hand-derived `fresnelFactor≈0.29289`). With lighting
forced to `diffuseSum=0`, result reduces to exactly `fresnelFactor * environmentMapColor` —
sampled at the exact vertical center, predicted `≈(129.3,64.6,32.3)`, observed exactly
`(129,65,32)` on both real XNA and CNA. All 12 scenes re-verified pixel-perfect afterward; full
`D3D9` CTest suite re-run, 11/11 still green.

**13th scene, `skinned_twobone_quad` (2026-07-15) — also pixel-perfect, first scene to exercise a
REAL, non-degenerate 2-bone skinning blend. Also fixed the SAME category of documentation-accuracy
gap the Fresnel scene found, this time in `skinned_quad.scene` itself.** New
`weightspervertex`/`bone1translate` scene keys; the vertex line format extended from 10 to an
optional 12 columns (a second `boneindex,boneweight` pair), backward compatible with existing
10-column lines. **Real finding**: `skinned_quad.scene`'s own comment claimed `WeightsPerVertex=1`,
but that property was never actually set, and real XNA's `SkinnedEffect` defaults
`WeightsPerVertex=4` (confirmed in FNA's source, matched by CNA) — so that scene had ACTUALLY been
running the `FourBones` bucket the whole time, harmless only because its single-pair vertex data
leaves weights `[1..3]=0`. Fixed with an explicit `weightspervertex=1`, now genuinely exercising
the `OneBone` bucket; re-verified `0/65536` differ, unchanged.

The new scene's formula (confirmed against FNA's own `SkinnedEffect.fx`): `skinning = Σ
Bones[Indices[i]] * Weights[i]`, a literal weighted sum of raw bone matrices. Bone 0 = Identity,
Bone 1 = `Translate(0.4,0,0)`, weights `0.5/0.5` — since both bones share the same Identity
rotation/scale part, the blend is exactly `Translate(0.2,0,0)`, a pure rightward shift of the
whole quad by `0.2` NDC units, normal (and lighting) unaffected. Sampled at the predicted shifted
boundaries: the original left edge correctly shows clear color, the lit `(128,128,128,255)` color
begins exactly at the shifted position, and clear color resumes exactly past the shifted right
edge — confirmed identical on both sides. All 13 scenes re-verified pixel-perfect afterward; full
`D3D9` CTest suite re-run, 11/11 still green.

**14th scene, `alphatest_notequal_quad` (2026-07-15) — also pixel-perfect, first scene to exercise
`AlphaFunction=NotEqual`, the negation of `alphatest_equal_quad.scene` within the SAME
`PSAlphaTestEqNe` shader bucket.** Confirmed against FNA's own `AlphaTestEffect.cs` source:
`NotEqual` uses the identical `abs(a - x) < y` comparison as `Equal`, only the pass/fail branch
targets are swapped. Reuses `alphatest_equal_quad.scene`'s exact texture/threshold, only
`AlphaFunction` changes — deliberately flips every texel's pass/fail (the exact-match `alpha=128`
texel now FAILS; the three near/far-miss texels now PASS), confirmed pixel-for-pixel identical.
No code changes needed (`NotEqual` already supported). This completes coverage of both
compare-function directions on both real pixel shader buckets (`Greater`/`Less` on
`PSAlphaTestLtGt`, `Equal`/`NotEqual` on `PSAlphaTestEqNe`). All 14 scenes re-verified
pixel-perfect afterward; full `D3D9` CTest suite re-run, 11/11 still green.

**15th/16th scenes, `alphatest_greaterequal_quad`/`alphatest_lessequal_quad` (2026-07-15) — also
pixel-perfect, exercise `GreaterEqual`/`LessEqual`, which share the `PSAlphaTestLtGt` bucket with
`Greater`/`Less` but differ from them specifically at the EXACT boundary value.** Confirmed
against FNA's own `AlphaTestEffect.cs`: `GreaterEqual` sets `alphaTest.X = reference - threshold`
(vs. `Greater`'s `reference + threshold`); `LessEqual` sets `reference + threshold` (vs. `Less`'s
`reference - threshold`) — a texel whose alpha exactly equals `ReferenceAlpha` PASSES under the
`-Equal` variant but would be DISCARDED under the plain variant. Both scenes reuse
`alphatest_equal_quad.scene`'s own texture (`alpha=128,127,129,1`) specifically because it already
has a texel at the exact `128` boundary — `alphatest_quad.scene`'s own texture never lands exactly
on `128`, so it could not distinguish these pairs at all. Both scenes' pass/fail patterns were
predicted before running either side, then confirmed pixel-for-pixel identical, `0/65536` differ
each. No code changes needed. Together these complete coverage of all 4 alpha-value-dependent
`PSAlphaTestLtGt` values; only alpha-value-independent `Never`/`Always` remain unrepresented in
that bucket. All 16 scenes re-verified pixel-perfect afterward; full `D3D9` CTest suite re-run,
11/11 still green.

**17th/18th scenes, `alphatest_never_quad`/`alphatest_always_quad` (2026-07-15) — also
pixel-perfect, COMPLETE ALL 8 REAL XNA `AlphaTestEffect.AlphaFunction` VALUES IN THE CORPUS.**
Confirmed against FNA's own `AlphaTestEffect.cs`: `Never` sets both branch targets negative —
`clip((a < x) ? z : w)` evaluates to `clip(-1)` unconditionally, discarding every fragment
regardless of alpha; `Always` sets both targets positive, `clip(1)` unconditionally, never
discarding anything. Both scenes reuse `alphatest_quad.scene`'s exact texture
(`alpha=255,1,255,64`) unchanged — under `Never`, all 4 texels (including the `alpha=255` ones
that would normally pass `Greater`) are discarded, rendering pure clear color everywhere; under
`Always`, all 4 texels (including the `alpha=1`/`alpha=64` ones that would normally fail
`Greater`) survive and show their own raw color. Confirmed pixel-for-pixel identical, `0/65536`
differ each. No code changes needed. **This closes out `AlphaTestEffect`'s entire
compare-function surface**: `Less`/`LessEqual`/`GreaterEqual`/`Greater`/`Never`/`Always` on
`PSAlphaTestLtGt`, `Equal`/`NotEqual` on `PSAlphaTestEqNe` — all 8 real XNA `AlphaFunction`
values now independently verified against the real reference implementation. All 18 scenes
re-verified pixel-perfect afterward; full `D3D9` CTest suite re-run, 11/11 still green.

**19th scene, `skinned_fourbone_quad` (2026-07-15) — also pixel-perfect, first scene to exercise
a REAL, non-degenerate 4-bone skinning blend, completing coverage of all 3 real
`WeightsPerVertex` values.** Extended the vertex line format to an optional 16 columns (a 3rd/4th
`boneindex,boneweight` pair), backward compatible. New `bone2translate`/`bone3translate` scene
keys. All four bones are pure translations (same Identity rotation/scale trick
`skinned_twobone_quad.scene` used): `Bone 0=Identity` (weight `0.4`), `Bone 1=Translate(0.4,0,0)`
(weight `0.3`), `Bone 2=Translate(0,0.2,0)` (weight `0.2`), `Bone 3=Translate(0,-0.1,0)` (weight
`0.1`). Hand-derived blend: `0.4*(0,0,0)+0.3*(0.4,0,0)+0.2*(0,0.2,0)+0.1*(0,-0.1,0) =
(0.12,0.03,0)` exactly — a genuine TWO-AXIS shift (unlike the 2-bone scene's pure-X shift),
proving all four weighted terms are summed correctly. Sampled at the predicted shifted
boundaries in both X and Y, confirmed identical on both real XNA and CNA. All 19 scenes
re-verified pixel-perfect afterward; full `D3D9` CTest suite re-run, 11/11 still green.

**Update 2026-07-15: `SpriteBatch` is no longer an open candidate here** — Phase D9-9
(`D9-90`/`D9-91`/`D9-92`/`D9-93`) is now fully CLOSED (7 new scenes total:
`sprite_basic_quad`/`sprite_rotated_quad`/`sprite_flipped_quad`/`sprite_wrap_quad`/
`sprite_mirror_quad`/`sprite_sortmode_deferred_quad`/`sprite_sortmode_backtofront_quad`/
`sprite_sortmode_fronttoback_quad`, all pixel-perfect), see Phase D9-9's own section below for
the full record — including a real D3D9 backend bug (`BuildMatrixTransformEXT`'s Z-row clipping
away any nonzero `layerDepth` sprite) found and fixed via `D9-93`. Render targets are now a
documented BLOCKER (see §4's own "New blocker found 2026-07-15"), not a simple next candidate —
do not re-attempt until root-caused. A genuine `SurfaceFormat` sweep needs new CNA `Texture2D`
API surface (a generic `SetData<T>` matching real XNA's own, since the current C++ API is
`Color`-only) before non-`Color` formats can even be exercised through the oracle — also not a
simple "add a scene" task.

### Phase D9-1 — CMake integration and skeleton: CLOSED 2026-07-14

| Task | Status |
|---|---|
| `D9-10` — `D3D9` added to all 7 `CMakeLists.txt` `"D3D12"` sites, minus one real correction | ✅ |
| `D9-11` — `D3D9GraphicsBackend` skeleton (22 pure virtuals + 10 silently-empty ones handled) | ✅ |
| `D9-12` — `GraphicsDevice.cpp` `#ifdef` audit | ✅ (zero changes needed) |

**Phase D9-1 is fully closed.** `D9-10` found one real, worth-fixing gap in this plan's own text: it
described CMake line 288 as "a second Windows-only-related OR chain" needing a D3D9 sibling, but that
line is actually the `D3DCommon` shared-core conditional — adding D3D9 there would have violated
design decision 12 ("`D3DCommon` is not expanded"). Left untouched, with an explanatory comment;
`plan_dx9.md`'s own `D9-10` row now records the correction. Line 392 (the `CNA` circular-link `OR`
chain) was also deliberately left out of D3D9's `OR` chain — nothing calls back into a CNA-defined
symbol yet (that's `D9-112`, Phase D9-11, ask-first).

### Phase D9-2 — mapping layer: CLOSED 2026-07-14 (one row 🟨)

| Task | Status |
|---|---|
| `D9-20` — `D3D9FormatMapping` (`SurfaceFormat`/`DepthFormat` → `D3DFORMAT`) | ✅ |
| `D9-21` — `D3D9StateMapping` (7 state enums → D3D9 equivalents) | 🟨 (table done; `D3DCULL` pixel-proof against the oracle owed to `D9-84`) |
| `D9-22` — `D3D9VertexDeclarations` (stride-keyed `D3DVERTEXELEMENT9` arrays) | ✅ (COLOR0 element type corrected `D9-82`, see that row) |
| `D9-23` — `D3D9_Common` CTest, mutation-verified | ✅ (28/28 checks) |

**Phase D9-2 is closed** (one honestly-flagged partial, not a blocker). Two non-obvious findings
worth knowing before touching this code: **`SurfaceFormat::Color` → `D3DFMT_A8B8G8R8`, NOT
`D3DFMT_A8R8G8B8`** (D3D9's channel-order naming reads MSB→LSB, opposite DXGI's convention — get this
backwards and every Color-format texture samples with R/B swapped); and **`Rgba1010102` →
`D3DFMT_A2B10G10R10`, NOT the superficially-similar `D3DFMT_A2R10G10B10`** (that one has no DXGI
equivalent at all — different alpha-bit position). Both verified against Microsoft's own published
D3D9→DXGI legacy-format table, not derived by name resemblance. Next up: Phase D9-3 (device, present,
device-lost).

### Phase D9-3 — device, present, device-lost: ALL 5 rows closed (D9-32/D9-34 honestly 🟨)

| Task | Status |
|---|---|
| `D9-30` — real `Direct3DCreate9`/`GetDeviceCaps`/`CreateDevice` with real presentation parameters | ✅ |
| `D9-31` — `Clear` + all 6 `Clear*` combos + `Present` + `ReadBackbuffer`, each pixel-verified | ✅ (`D3D9_Smoke`) |
| `D9-32` — enforce `GraphicsProfile` floor at construction | 🟨 (shader-model floor real; full Reach/HiDef table is `D9-100`'s job) |
| `D9-33` — window resize via device `Reset()` | ✅ (mechanism + dedicated 64×64→96×80 test, Check L) |
| `D9-34` — XNA device-lost lifecycle | 🟨 (real mechanism + real event order proven via `DebugSimulateContextLoss`; genuine driver-triggered loss + event-payload-vs-real-XNA fidelity are `D9-A`/`D9-140`'s own jobs) |

**Phase D9-3 is now fully closed** (both 🟨 rows have named, honest, out-of-this-plan's-current-reach
gaps, not missed work). `D9-34`: `Present()` detects real `D3DERR_DEVICELOST`, fires `DeviceLost`;
`PollDeviceLost()` polls `TestCooperativeLevel()` until `D3DERR_DEVICENOTRESET`, then
`PerformResetRecovery()` fires `DeviceResetting`, calls a real `Reset()`, restores the viewport, fires
`DeviceReset`. Since DXVK will rarely lose the device naturally, the full sequence was exercised
deterministically via the pre-existing `DebugSimulateContextLoss()`/`DebugRestoreContext()` test
channel (`D3D9_Smoke` Check M, 8 new checks) — real event counts/order, a real `Clear()` throwing the
real XNA `DeviceLostException` while lost, a real `Reset()` call during recovery, and the device
genuinely rendering again afterward. Also fixed a separate, pre-existing gap found along the way:
`GraphicsDevice::getGraphicsDeviceStatusProperty()` was hardcoded `return
GraphicsDeviceStatus::Normal;` always — now tracks the real backend-reported state.

**Two real, unplanned findings surfaced while closing D9-30/D9-31, both fixed in place:**

1. **D3D9 rejects `SurfaceFormat::Color`'s own `D9-20` back-buffer format.** DXVK's D3D9
   implementation (correctly matching real D3D9 behavior) refused `D3DFMT_A8B8G8R8` as a *swap-chain*
   format — that format is legal for textures but D3D9 restricts the primary back buffer to a small
   set of display-compatible formats. Fixed with a back-buffer-specific substitution to `A8R8G8B8`
   (`ReadBackbuffer()` already handles both byte orders). Not a DXVK quirk — a real, confirmed D3D9
   API restriction, documented in `D3D9GraphicsBackend.cpp`.
2. **`GraphicsDevice::Reset()` never told an already-constructed backend about updated back-buffer/
   depth-stencil/fullscreen settings** — only virtual resolution and MSAA were re-pushed. This matters
   because `Game` typically constructs its `GraphicsDevice` (and backend) with *default*
   `PresentationParameters`, before `GraphicsDeviceManager.ApplyChanges()` ever applies the game's real
   preferences. Fixed with one more small additive `IGraphicsBackend` method,
   `UpdatePresentationFormatEXT()` (empty default; every other backend ignores it unchanged) — the
   same category of fix as the already-approved boundary-problem resolution, not a new architectural
   decision.

**A third finding forced Phase D9-6 (render states) in far earlier than planned.**
`GraphicsDevice`'s own constructor unconditionally pushes `BlendState::Opaque`/
`DepthStencilState::Default`/`RasterizerState::CullCounterClockwise` and the viewport (Task 896/955) —
meaning `ApplyBlendState`/`SetBlendFactor`/`ApplyDepthStencilState`/`SetReferenceStencil`/
`ApplyRasterizerState`/`SetViewport`/`SetScissorRect` could not stay `NotYetImplemented()` stubs for
*any* device to finish constructing, regardless of this plan's own phase ordering. All are now real
(`D3DRS_*` `SetRenderState()` sequences via the `D9-21` mapping tables — see §2's Phase D9-6 entry
below). Along the way, also found that `D9-11`'s own "10 silently-empty virtuals" count missed 4 more
(`ApplyBlendState`/`ApplyDepthStencilState`/`ApplyRasterizerState`/`ApplySamplerState`) because their
`{}` defaults span multiple lines, invisible to a single-line `grep`; `ApplySamplerState` now throws
`NotYetImplemented()` like the original 10 (nothing forced it in early — no texture/sampler work
exists yet).

### Phase D9-6 — render states: ALL 5 rows closed (D9-60/D9-62 honestly 🟨)

| Task | Status |
|---|---|
| `D9-60` — `ApplyBlendState`/`SetBlendFactor` | 🟨 (real; `D3DRS_COLORWRITEENABLE` genuinely out of scope — see plan) |
| `D9-61` — `ApplyDepthStencilState`/`SetReferenceStencil` | ✅ |
| `D9-62` — `ApplyRasterizerState`/`SetScissorRect`/`SetViewport` | 🟨 (real; oracle pixel-proof owed to `D9-84`, same as `D9-21`'s own `D3DCULL` obligation) |
| `D9-63` — `ApplySamplerState` | ✅ |
| `D9-64` — reuse backend-agnostic state CTest sources | ✅ |

`D9-64` closed 2026-07-15: reused the same 4-test subset D3D11 established
(`easygl_blendstate_opaque_test.cpp`/`easygl_blendstate_alphablend_test.cpp`/
`easygl_depthstencilstate_stencil_enable_test.cpp`/`easygl_rasterizerstate_cullmode_test.cpp`,
verbatim, unmodified) as new `D3D9_BlendState_Opaque`/`D3D9_BlendState_AlphaBlend`/
`D3D9_DepthStencilState_StencilEnable`/`D3D9_RasterizerState_CullMode` CTests. **Found and fixed
two real, pre-existing D3D9 backend bugs along the way** (both mutation-verified, neither an
EasyGL-test workaround): `SetDepthTestEnabled`/`SetDepthWriteEnabled` were silent-throw stubs since
`D9-11`'s original skeleton, never wired up — same class of bug as D3D11's own 2026-07-14
`SetDepthTestEnabled` fix (commit `191c28f1`), now direct `SetRenderState(D3DRS_ZENABLE/
ZWRITEENABLE)` calls (`SetBlendEnabled` made a deliberate no-op, matching D3D11/D3D12); and
`UpdatePresentationFormatEXT()` deferred applying a changed `DepthStencilFormat` until the next
`Present()`, causing `Clear()` to fail with `D3DERR_INVALIDCALL` on any test that draws
depth/stencil content on the literal first frame (every pre-existing D3D9 test worked around this
with a `frame_++ < 1` skip; the reused EasyGL tests don't) — fixed by applying eagerly inside
`UpdatePresentationFormatEXT()` itself, within the interface's own documented allowance. New
`D3D9_Smoke` Check Z (2 checks, ported from D3D11's own identical near/far depth-test proof)
proves the `SetDepthTestEnabled` fix is real. Full D3D9 CTest suite: 11/11 binaries green.

Real, confirmed finding: D3D9's `D3DRS_DEPTHBIAS`/`SLOPESCALEDEPTHBIAS` are floats, and XNA's own
float `DepthBias`/`SlopeScaleDepthBias` map through with **no unit conversion** (unlike D3D11, which
needs float→`INT` rounding) — `SetRenderState()` still takes a `DWORD` parameter, so the float bits
are reinterpreted (`std::bit_cast`), not numerically converted.

`D9-63` (`ApplySamplerState`, closed once `D9-50`'s real textures made it meaningful): plain
`SetSamplerState()` calls (design decision 11 — no D3D9 sampler state objects), using the `D9-21`
mapping tables. Slot bound-checked against the real `D3DCAPS9::MaxSimultaneousTextures`, not a
hardcoded 16. `D3DSAMP_SRGBTEXTURE` is genuinely out of scope — `IGraphicsBackend::ApplySamplerState()`'s
own signature carries no sRGB parameter at all, same category of pre-existing interface gap `D9-60`
already found for `D3DRS_COLORWRITEENABLE`. New `D3D9_Smoke` Check Y (2 checks): `SetSamplerState()`
values read back directly via `GetSamplerState()` (no draw call needed) confirm an exact match; an
out-of-range slot silently no-ops. Mutation-verified (hardcoded `D3DSAMP_ADDRESSU` to ignore the
requested value, confirmed exactly that assertion went red). `D3D9_Smoke` now 53/53.

### Phase D9-4 — buffers: D9-40/D9-41/D9-42 CLOSED

| Task | Status |
|---|---|
| `D9-40` — `D3D9VertexBufferBackend` | ✅ |
| `D9-41` — `D3D9IndexBufferBackend`, 16-bit and 32-bit, `CreateIndexBuffer32()` explicit | ✅ |
| `D9-42` — byte-exact round-trip tests | ✅ (folded into D9-40/41's own checks) |

Real architectural finding, not anticipated by this row's own plan text: `D3DUSAGE_DYNAMIC` requires
`D3DPOOL_DEFAULT` (D3D9 forbids `DYNAMIC` with `POOL_MANAGED`), so these buffers do **not** survive a
device `Reset()` the way ordinary `D3DPOOL_MANAGED` resources do. New `ID3D9DefaultPoolResourceEXT`
interface + a small registry on `D3D9GraphicsBackend` lets `D9-34`'s `PerformResetRecovery()` release
every live `D3DPOOL_DEFAULT` resource before `Reset()`; each recreates lazily on next use — real,
authentic D3D9/XNA behavior (a `DYNAMIC` buffer's content genuinely does not survive `DeviceReset` in
real XNA either). Mutation-verified: temporarily broke `CreateIndexBuffer32()` to build a 16-bit
buffer instead — caught immediately (a real, uncaught exception from the existing type-mismatch
guard), reverted, reconfirmed green. Also confirmed and fixed the exact "pointer-inequality is not
sound proof of recreation" false-negative this project's own D3D12 work already found once (see
`plan_dx9.md`'s `D9-40` row). `D3D9_Smoke` is now 30/30 checks.

### Phase D9-5 — textures/render targets/readback: FULLY CLOSED (all 7 rows)

| Task | Status |
|---|---|
| `D9-50` — `D3D9TextureBackend` (`IDirect3DTexture9`, `D3DPOOL_MANAGED`), mip levels, sub-rect `SetData` | ✅ |
| `D9-51` — `D3D9TextureCubeBackend`/`D3D9Texture3DBackend`, volume support gated on real `D3DCAPS9` | ✅ |
| `D9-52` — `GetData()` for 2D/cube/3D | ✅ (found empirically: 2D has none to implement — `Texture2D::GetData()` is CPU-shadow-based, same as D3D11; cube/3D genuinely delegate to the backend and are real `LockRect`/`LockBox` reads) |
| `D9-53` — `D3D9RenderTargetBackend`/`D3D9RenderTargetCubeBackend` (`D3DUSAGE_RENDERTARGET`, `D3DPOOL_DEFAULT`, real MSAA) | ✅ |
| `D9-54` — MRT via `SetRenderTarget(i, surface)`, capped at `NumSimultaneousRTs`, over-request throws | ✅ |
| `D9-55` — `D3D9OcclusionQueryBackend` | ✅ |
| `D9-56` — NPOT handling driven by `D3DPTEXTURECAPS_POW2`/`NONPOW2CONDITIONAL` | ✅ |

New `include/`/`src/CNA/Internal/Backends/D3D9/D3D9Textures.hpp`+`.cpp`. All three texture backends use
`D3DFMT_A8B8G8R8`/`D3DPOOL_MANAGED` (RGBA8 storage only, same simplification D3D11 already documents —
`surfaceFormat` accepted for signature compatibility, not honored). Since `D3DPOOL_MANAGED` (not
`DEFAULT`), none of these register with the `D9-40` device-lost registry — they survive `Reset()`
automatically, same as `D9-4`'s own spike found. Cube-face order (0..5 = +X,-X,+Y,-Y,+Z,-Z) matches
D3D9's own native `D3DCUBEMAP_FACES` enum order, so no face-remapping table is needed. Volume-texture
creation is gated on `D3DCAPS9::MaxVolumeExtent > 0`, cube-map creation on
`D3DPTEXTURECAPS_CUBEMAP` — both report supported on this dev environment's DXVK device, so `D3D9_Smoke`
Check R exercises the real creation path for both, not just the capability-gate branch (the
unsupported/`nullptr` branch is exercised by construction but not provably reachable without
lesser-capable hardware — an honest gap, not a hidden one). Wired into `D3D9GraphicsBackend::CreateTexture()`/
`CreateTextureCube()`/`CreateTexture3D()` (previously stubs/inherited `nullptr` defaults). `D3D9_Smoke`
Checks Q/R (6 new checks) verify exact-byte round-trips via direct `LockRect`/`LockBox` on the
`D3DPOOL_MANAGED` resources themselves — no staging-texture copy needed, unlike D3D11's equivalent
check. Mutation-verified (see §3). `D3D9_Smoke` now 36/36.

New `include/`/`src/CNA/Internal/Backends/D3D9/D3D9RenderTargets.hpp`+`.cpp` (`D9-53`).
`D3D9RenderTargetBackend`/`D3D9RenderTargetCubeBackend`, both `D3DPOOL_DEFAULT` and registered with the
`D9-40` device-lost registry (unlike the plain `D9-50` textures) — released before `Reset()`, lazily
recreated on the next `BindAsRenderTarget()`/`BindAsRenderTargetFace()` call. Real MSAA, clamped via
`IDirect3D9::CheckDeviceMultiSampleType()` (all-or-nothing, no step-down ladder — matches D3D11's own
precedent); an MSAA target resolves into its sampleable texture via `StretchRect` on unbind. Cube
render targets don't support MSAA (matches D3D11's own precedent). Mip auto-generation is NOT
implemented (named gap). Three real, unplanned findings, all fixed: (1) the resize path
(`EnsureDeviceSize()`) never released `D3DPOOL_DEFAULT` resources before `Reset()` — only the
device-lost path did; a real D3D9 requirement, invisible until this task actually created one during
a resize-adjacent test; (2) a cached depth-stencil-surface `ComPtr` is itself an app-held reference to
a losable resource, and must be released before every `Reset()` too (caught immediately by DXVK's own
"still has alive losable resources" diagnostic); (3) `IGraphicsBackend::SetRenderTargetCubeFace()`'s
inherited default never actually unbinds a cube target for real (it only knows the 2D-only
`currentCustomRT_` tracking) — fixed with an explicit `D3D9GraphicsBackend::SetRenderTargetCubeFace()`
override and a second `currentCustomCubeRT_` field. `D3D9_Smoke` Checks S/T/U (6 new checks): 2D
target, cube target, and MSAA target, each create/bind/Clear/readback (via `GetRenderTargetData()`,
since a render-target surface is not directly `Lockable`)/unbind-restores-back-buffer. Mutation-verified
(dropped the MSAA resolve `StretchRect` call — exactly Check U's resolve assertion went red, nothing
else). `D3D9_Smoke` now 43/43.

`D9-54` (MRT): real `D3D9GraphicsBackend::SetRenderTargets(rts, count)` (`SetRenderTarget(i, surface)`
for `i=0..count-1`, unused slots up to `NumSimultaneousRTs` explicitly disabled). Over-request throws
`std::runtime_error` naming both counts (design decision 13) — deliberately **not** matching
D3D11/D3D12's own silent-clamp precedent, the exact invisible-capability trap this authenticity-focused
backend does not accept. "Same bit depth"/"no independent blending" are trivially satisfied by this
project's existing simplifications (every target is `D3DFMT_A8B8G8R8`; blend state is one global
`SetRenderState()` sequence) — noted, not actively coded. Real, unplanned finding: an MRT bind is not
representable by the existing single-pointer `currentCustomRT_`/`currentCustomCubeRT_` tracking (same
gap D3D11's own `SetRenderTargets()` notes), so unbinding via `SetRenderTargets(nullptr, 0)` →
`SetRenderTarget2D(nullptr)` was silently relying on `UnbindAsRenderTarget()` to restore the back
buffer — which never fires when nothing was tracked. Fixed by making
`RestoreBackBufferRenderTargetEXT()` unconditional in the `!rt` branches of `SetRenderTarget2D()`/
`SetRenderTargetCubeFace()` (idempotent in the ordinary case, the real fix for MRT). New `D3D9_Smoke`
Check V (3 checks): a 2-target MRT bind + single `Clear()` writes the exact color into both targets'
own surfaces, unbind restores the back buffer, and over-request throws. Mutation-verified (disabled the
over-request guard, exactly that assertion went red). `D3D9_Smoke` now 46/46.

`D9-55` (occlusion queries): new `D3D9OcclusionQueryBackend` (`IDirect3DQuery9`,
`D3DQUERYTYPE_OCCLUSION`) — `Begin()`/`End()` → `Issue(D3DISSUE_BEGIN)`/`Issue(D3DISSUE_END)`;
`IsComplete()`/`PixelCount()` → `GetData()` (mirrors `D3D11OcclusionQueryBackend`'s shape). Gated on
the official D3D9 support-probe idiom (`CreateQuery(type, nullptr)`), not assumed. New `D3D9_Smoke`
Check W (3 checks): real query created, polled to complete within a bounded 30-iteration loop
(matches `D9-33`'s own resize-convergence convention), `PixelCount()` reads back `0` for a query
wrapping only a `Clear()` (no draw path exists yet, `D9-82` — a real, honest result, not a stand-in
for tested geometry). Mutation-verified (forced `IsComplete()` to always return `false`, confirmed
exactly that one assertion went red — the `PixelCount()==0` assertion correctly stayed green too,
since `GetData()` "not ready" and "genuinely 0 samples" both honestly return 0, not a masking bug).
`D3D9_Smoke` now 49/49.

`D9-56` (NPOT capability, **closes Phase D9-5 entirely — all 7 rows now done**): new NOXNA
`D3D9GraphicsBackend::RequiresPowerOfTwoTexturesEXT()`/`NonPowerOfTwoRequiresClampAddressingEXT()`
surface the real `D3DCAPS9::TextureCaps` `POW2`/`NONPOW2CONDITIONAL` bits rather than assuming a
value — the exact cap XNA's own `Reach` profile "no Wrap addressing on NPOT" restriction models.
This dev environment's DXVK device reports full, unconditional NPOT support (both helpers `false`),
matching `D9-3`'s own original caps dump. New `D3D9_Smoke` Check X (2 checks): asserts the exact
reported capability, then creates and round-trips a genuinely non-power-of-two (5×3)
`D3D9TextureBackend` for real, proving no artificial POW2 restriction exists on top of more-permissive
real hardware. Enforcing the `Reach`-profile restriction itself against a real `SamplerState`/draw
call is deferred to `D9-10`/`D9-82` (no draw/sampler path exists yet) — an honest gap, not hidden.
Mutation-verified (hardcoded `RequiresPowerOfTwoTexturesEXT()` to always return `true`, confirmed
exactly the capability assertion went red and the NPOT round-trip proof was consistently skipped).
`D3D9_Smoke` now 51/51.

### Phase D9-7 — Microsoft's stock effects: vendor, compile, embed: FULLY CLOSED (D9-73 honestly 🟨)

| Task | Status |
|---|---|
| `D9-70` — vendor the 10 Stock Effects HLSL sources verbatim | ✅ |
| `D9-71` — offline-compile all 66 entry points to `d3d9_shaders.hpp` | ✅ |
| `D9-72` — transcribe register annotations into `D3D9ShaderRegisters.hpp` | ✅ |
| `D9-73` — cross-check against Microsoft's shipped `.fxb` bytecode | 🟨 (already run in Phase D9-0: 61/66 exact; re-confirmed against the real checked-in header too; 5 `PixelLighting` variants owed to `D9-84`'s oracle proof) |
| `D9-74` — `D3D9ShaderCache` creates all 66 through a live device | ✅ |

`D9-70`: all 10 files (`BasicEffect.fx`, `AlphaTestEffect.fx`, `DualTextureEffect.fx`,
`EnvironmentMapEffect.fx`, `SkinnedEffect.fx`, `SpriteEffect.fx`, `Macros.fxh`, `Common.fxh`,
`Lighting.fxh`, `Structures.fxh`) copied byte-for-byte from the FNA tree into
`src/CNA/Internal/Backends/D3D9/shaders/xna/`, with `LICENSE` (Ms-PL), a provenance `README.md`
(66 entry points, each verified via `grep`, not hand-typed — an initial draft had 4 wrong names for
`EnvironmentMapEffect.fx`/`SkinnedEffect.fx`, caught by actually running the grep before publishing
it), and a specific `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md` entry. New `scripts/verify-d3d9-stock-effects-vendored.sh`
mechanically diffs the vendored copies against the FNA tree; mutation-verified (appended a line to
the vendored `BasicEffect.fx`, confirmed the script reports `MISMATCH`/exit 1, reverted). Not a
CTest — depends on the FNA reference tree being present on the machine, same reasoning `D9-71`'s own
row gives for its own "run by hand" pipeline.

`D9-71`: new `src/CNA/Internal/Backends/D3D9/shaders/compile_shaders_sm2.py` — parses all 66 entry
points from the vendored `.fx` files' own `compile [vp]s_2_0 ...` statements via regex (not
hand-maintained), cross-builds `fxc_tool.cpp` (moved here unchanged from `dx9-spike/`, along with
`compare_against_fxb.py`) with MinGW-w64, invokes it via a bare `wine` call against
`~/.wine-cna-d3d9-spike` (not `run-wine-dxvk9.sh` — compiling never opens a device). **Real run:
66/66 compiled, 0 failures.** Output `d3d9_shaders.hpp` (381 KB, `k<EffectName>_<EntryPointName>`
array names) confirmed to compile clean as real C++; a second run produced a byte-identical header
(deterministic). Bonus verification: re-ran `compare_against_fxb.py` against the real checked-in
header's own bytecode — 61/66 exact matches, the identical 5 `PixelLighting` variants the Phase
D9-0 spike already found, confirming the real pipeline reproduces the spike's result exactly.
`dx9-spike/README.md` updated to reflect the move (only `xna-oracle/Oracle.cs` remains there).

`D9-72`: **a real, empirical finding changed this row's own original approach mid-task.** The plan
assumed a per-effect register table hand-derived from the `.fx` files' own `_vs(cN)`/`_ps(cN)`
annotations, with register COUNT inferred from each constant's declared HLSL type
(`float4x4`→4 registers, `float3x3`→3, etc.). **That assumption is provably wrong**: compiling
`EnvironmentMapEffect.fx`'s `VSEnvMap` and disassembling the real output (`D3DDisassemble()`) shows
`World` (declared `float4x4`) is allocated only **3** registers (`c16`-`c18`) by the real compiler
for this specific entry point — its `mul(vin.Position, World)` never reads `pos_ws.w`, so the
compiler drops the register that would compute it — while `WorldInverseTranspose` genuinely
occupies `c19`-`c21`, an apparent overlap with a naive 4-register `World` assumption that isn't
actually a conflict. **Register occupancy depends on what a given ENTRY POINT reads, not just a
constant's declared type.** Redesigned scope: new `extract_shader_registers.py` compiles **and
disassembles** each of the 66 shaders, parsing the compiler's own authoritative `// Registers:`
comment block directly (new `disasm_tool.cpp`, a small `D3DDisassemble()`-calling companion to
`fxc_tool.cpp`). Output: `D3D9ShaderRegisters.hpp` (627 lines, one array per shader:
`{name, space, registerIndex, registerCount}`). Compiles clean (`-Wall -Wextra -fsyntax-only`, zero
warnings); spot-checked against 3 independently-verified cases (`BasicEffect` `VSBasic`,
`EnvironmentMapEffect` `VSEnvMap`'s `World`/`WorldInverseTranspose` split, `SkinnedEffect`'s 72-bone
array at `c26` size 216 = 72×3 registers). No fixed-layout POD struct exists to `static_assert`
against (this row's own original wording) since occupancy varies per entry point — the generated
tables themselves are the verified ground truth. `D3DConstantBuffers.hpp` was checked and NOT
reused — different register scheme entirely (D3D11's own cbuffer reimplementation vs. D3D9's flat
register file), exactly as this row's own note anticipated.

`D9-74` (**Phase D9-7 now fully closed** — `D9-73` stays honestly 🟨, its own deferred obligation
unaffected): took option (a) from this row's own recommendation — `dxvk-setup install` run against
`~/.wine-cna-d3d9-spike` (same command `plan_dx.md`'s `DX-2` used for `~/.wine-cna-d3d11`), verified
for real (`d3d9.dll` now a DXVK symlink; `d3dcompiler_47.dll` untouched — confirmed by re-running the
full `D3D9_Smoke` suite against this prefix, 53/53 pass). New `D3D9ShaderCache` (`CreateVertexShader`/
`CreatePixelShader` per named entry point, e.g. `"BasicEffect_VSBasic"`, lazy-create-and-cache),
backed by a new `Shaders::kAllShaders[]` manifest (66 entries) appended to `compile_shaders_sm2.py`'s
own output — regenerated, not hand-typed. New `D3D9_ShaderCache` CTest (4 checks): all 66 shaders
(42 vertex + 24 pixel) create through a live device; a second lookup returns the identical cached
object; an unknown name throws; the lookup is stage-aware (a real VS name via `GetPixelShader()`
throws too, and vice versa). Runs clean against both the default CTest prefix and the newly-DXVK
-equipped compiler prefix. Mutation-verified (made `CreateAllEXT()` skip the first pixel shader,
confirmed exactly the count-dependent checks went red). Full 3-CTest D3D9 suite passes.

### Phase D9-8 — XNA shader dispatch: D9-80–D9-83 ALL CLOSED (all 5 Stock Effects real + instancing), only D9-84 open

| Task | Status |
|---|---|
| `D9-80` — replicate XNA's shader-permutation model (`VSIndices`/`PSIndices`/`ShaderIndex`) | ✅ |
| `D9-81` — audit `GpuDrawParams` vs. XNA's real `ShaderIndex` inputs, report the gaps | ✅ |
| `D9-82` — upload constants at Microsoft's registers; `DrawColoredPrimitives`/`DrawIndexedColoredPrimitives` (non-effect-aware, BasicEffect-VertexColor-only scope) | ✅ |
| `D9-82b` — `DrawPrimitivesEx`/`DrawIndexedPrimitivesEx` entry point + `BasicEffect` dispatch | ✅ |
| `D9-82c` — `AlphaTestEffect` dispatch | ✅ |
| `D9-82d` — `DualTextureEffect` dispatch | ✅ |
| `D9-82e` — `EnvironmentMapEffect` dispatch | ✅ |
| `D9-82f` — `SkinnedEffect` dispatch | ✅ |
| `D9-83` — `DrawInstancedPrimitivesEx` via `SetStreamSourceFreq` | ✅ |
| `D9-84` — every draw path validated against the oracle | ⬜ |

`D9-81`: the audit's own findings were already fully written into the plan row when `plan_dx9.md`
was first authored (2026-07-14) — this closure is an independent RE-VERIFICATION against the
CURRENT source (not trusted from memory), via a forked agent that read every cited file directly.
**Result: all 4 gaps are still real, and 2 of the 4 turn out resolvable without any `GpuDrawParams`
change** — `oneLight` (`SkinnedEffect.cpp` already computes it from the real `Enabled` properties
internally) and `AlphaTestEffect`'s `isEqNe` (`alphaTest[1]` (tolerance) `> 0` is a **lossless**,
provably-exact recovery from `AlphaTestEffect.cs`'s own `alphaTest.Y = threshold` assignment, which
fires in exactly the `Equal`/`NotEqual` cases and nowhere else — not the "plausible inference, may
misfire" the plan's own original wording hedged). `PreferPerPixelLighting` and
`EnvironmentMapEffect`'s `specularEnabled` remain genuine, unresolved gaps needing a cross-cutting,
project-owner-level `GpuDrawParams` decision — reported, not fixed, per this row's own instruction.

`D9-80`: new `include/`/`src/CNA/Internal/Backends/D3D9/D3D9ShaderDispatch.hpp`+`.cpp` — for all 5
effects, a `Compute<Effect>ShaderIndex()` ported line-for-line from that effect's own `OnApply()`
in the FNA `.cs` source, plus `Get<Effect>{Vertex,Pixel}ShaderNameEXT()` backed by the
`VSIndices`/`PSIndices`/`VSArray`/`PSArray` tables transcribed directly from the vendored `.fx`
file's own rows. Functions take the real XNA-shaped booleans as parameters, not `GpuDrawParams` —
sourcing them correctly (using `D9-81`'s own findings for `oneLight`/`isEqNe`) is `D9-82`'s job.
New `D3D9_ShaderDispatch` CTest (pure-function, no device needed), 23 checks. **Mutation-testing
found a real gap in the test's own first draft**: an initial "exhaustive sweep" only checked that
resolved names started with the right effect prefix — a deliberately-corrupted single `VSIndices`
table entry (mapped to a WRONG-but-still-real, same-prefixed name) was NOT caught by that weaker
check. Rewrote it as an exact-match sweep against a second, independently-typed expected-name array
in the test file; re-ran the same mutation, now correctly caught (exact mismatch reported); reverted,
reconfirmed 23/23 green. Full D3D9 CTest suite (4 binaries) passes.

`D9-82`: split from its own original single-row scope into `D9-82` (this narrow, non-effect-aware
"colored3d-equivalent" slice) + `D9-82b` (full effect-aware dispatch) — mirrors `plan_dx.md`'s own
`DX-61` vs. `DX-62..67` precedent exactly, same rationale (real, separate-scale work, not a
same-sitting extension). This backend's first real 3D triangle: new `D3D9ConstantUpload.hpp`+`.cpp`
(name-keyed register lookup + `Set{Vertex,Pixel}ShaderConstantF`, throws on a genuine
transcription-mismatch, silently no-ops against a variant with no named constants), real
`D3D9GraphicsBackend::DrawColoredPrimitives`/`DrawIndexedColoredPrimitives` (stride-16 only,
hardcoded to `BasicEffect` `ShaderIndex 3` = `"BasicEffect_VSBasicVcNoFog"`/`"BasicEffect_PSBasicNoFog"`,
chaining `D9-80`'s dispatch tables into `D9-74`'s shader cache), and a new stride-keyed
`IDirect3DVertexDeclaration9` cache. **A second real trap found and fixed live** (not the `D3DCULL`
one this row's own text predicted — a different one): `D9-22`'s original vertex declaration used
`D3DDECLTYPE_D3DCOLOR` for `COLOR0`, which Microsoft's own D3DDECLTYPE reference says expects
ARGB-packed memory bytes and swizzles them to RGBA — but XNA's own `Color.PackedValue` is R,G,B,A
ascending, so feeding it through `D3DDECLTYPE_D3DCOLOR` silently swaps R and B. Confirmed live before
fixing (fed opaque red, read back opaque blue), fixed by switching to `D3DDECLTYPE_UBYTE4N` (no
reorder), re-confirmed live (exact red). `D3D9_Common`'s own stride-16/24 assertions updated to
match. New `D3D9_Draw` CTest (real device draw): 3/3 (non-indexed paint, indexed paint, and a real
`WorldViewProj`-upload proof via an off-screen `World` translation). Mutation-verified: corrupted
`DiffuseColor`'s upload value, confirmed only the mutated (non-indexed) check went red while the
indexed/transform checks stayed green (correctly isolated blast radius); reverted, reconfirmed 3/3
green. Full D3D9 CTest suite (5 binaries) passes.

`D9-82b`: new `D3D9EffectDraw.cpp` — `DrawPrimitivesExImpl()` (the shared entry point, same
flag-priority-cascade shape `D3D11GraphicsBackend::DrawPrimitivesExImpl` already uses) +
`DrawBasicEffectEXT()`. New "soft" `TryUpload{Vertex,Pixel}ShaderConstantEXT()` (never throws on a
missing name) added to `D3D9ConstantUpload` — the generic dispatcher attempts EVERY constant
`BasicEffect` could ever declare and lets each variant's own real (`D9-72`) register table silently
filter out whichever don't apply.

**Real, honest scope-narrowing finding: only 10 of `BasicEffect`'s 32 `ShaderIndex` values are
actually drawable, not the 24 this row originally estimated.** `BasicEffect`'s remaining `VSInput`
shapes need vertex layouts this project's 5 established strides (16/20/24/32/52) simply don't
have (`VSInput` Position-only 12 bytes; `VSInputNm` Position+Normal 24 bytes — collides with the
EXISTING Position+Color+TexCoord 24-byte layout; `VSInputNmVc`/`VSInputNmTxVc` 28/36 bytes) — every
unsupported combination throws a named "no matching CNA vertex layout" error (same honest-gap
category as D3D11's own "`dual_texture_colored3d` not ported"), not a silent wrong-stride draw.

**`D9-81`'s `oneLight` finding corrected during real implementation** — its original text ("read
`SkinnedEffect.cpp`'s own internal `oneLight_` directly") turned out not actually reachable from
`IGraphicsBackend::DrawPrimitivesEx()`'s own `GpuDrawParams`-only input (no channel back to the
originating `Effect` object's private members). Real fix: a light with BOTH diffuse and specular
still `(0,0,0)` contributes exactly zero to `Lighting.fxh`'s `ComputeLights()` regardless of
`Enabled`, so `oneLight` is derivable losslessly from `GpuDrawParams`' own existing fields — no
`GpuDrawParams` extension needed after all (that row's own text updated to match).

Also found/derived live: the `EffectParameter.SetValue(Matrix)` register-transpose trick generalizes
correctly to a `float3x3`-declared constant (`WorldInverseTranspose`) as well as a truncated
`float4x4` (`World`, 3 of 4 registers — the same "entry point never reads `.w`" pattern `D9-72`
first found for `EnvironmentMapEffect`, now confirmed for `BasicEffect`'s lit path too); `EmissiveColor`
needed reconstruction from `GpuDrawParams`' separate `ambientColor`/`diffuseColor`/`emissiveColor`
fields (`emissiveColor + ambientColor*diffuseColor`, matching `Lighting.fxh` exactly).

New `D3D9_DrawEx` CTest (real device draw), 10/10 at the time — every expected pixel HAND-COMPUTED
from `BasicEffect.fx`/`Lighting.fxh`'s own real formulas: unlit+textured, unlit+vertexColor+textured,
lit+textured 2-light-sum (exact `(150,90,30)`), lit+textured 1-light/`OneLight` bucket (exact
`(80,48,16)` — deliberately different from the 2-light case so the pair together proves correct
bucket selection), fog fully-fogged (exact `FogColor` readback), an unsupported combo throws, and
`AlphaTestEffect`/`DualTextureEffect`/`EnvironmentMapEffect`/`SkinnedEffect` each throw their own
named not-yet-implemented (`D9-82c`/`d`/`e`/`f`). Mutation-verified: forced `oneLight` to always
`true`; exactly the 2-light check (the only one sensitive to a bucket-selection bug) went red,
everything else stayed green; reverted, reconfirmed 10/10. Full D3D9 CTest suite (6 binaries) passes.

`D9-82c`: new `D3D9GraphicsBackend::DrawAlphaTestEffectEXT()` (same file) — all 8 `ShaderIndex`
values real, no vertex-layout gap this time (`AlphaTestEffect`'s only two `VSInput` shapes map 1:1
onto the existing stride-20/24 layouts, unlike `BasicEffect`'s case). `GpuDrawParams::alphaTest` is
already exactly the real `{refVal,tolerance,passWeight,failWeight}` register layout
`AlphaTestEffect.fx`'s own `clip()` expressions expect — uploaded verbatim, no reconstruction
needed (confirmed directly against the `.fx` source). Factored `ComputeFogVectorEXT()` out of
`DrawBasicEffectEXT()` into a shared helper both effects now use. `D3D9_DrawEx` extended to 12/12:
3 new real checks (`Less` compare passes with an exact `texture*DiffuseColor` readback, `Less`
compare fails with the background genuinely left unpainted proving `clip()` really discards, `Equal`
compare passes on the vertex-color bucket). Mutation-verified: forced `isEqNe` to always `false`;
exactly the `Equal`-bucket check (the only one sensitive to a wrong PS selection) went red, the two
`Less`-bucket checks stayed green; reverted, reconfirmed 12/12. Full D3D9 CTest suite (6 binaries)
passes.

`D9-82d`: new `D3D9GraphicsBackend::DrawDualTextureEffectEXT()` (same file). **This row's own
original "4 ShaderIndex values, all unblocked" claim was wrong — corrected during real
implementation: only 2 of the 4 are actually drawable.** Real finding: `DualTextureEffect.fx`'s
real `VSInputTx2` needs a Position+TexCoord0+TexCoord1 vertex (28 bytes) with no equivalent at all
among the 5 layouts D3D9/D3D11/D3D12 previously shared (D3D11's own `dual_texture3d.vert.hlsl`
sidesteps this with a single shared UV set — a legitimate simplification for a custom
reimplementation, not an option here, since this backend draws Microsoft's real unmodified
compiled shader). **Resolved by adding a new, D3D9-only stride-28 vertex declaration**
(`D3D9VertexDeclarations.hpp`/`.cpp`) — safe and backend-local (design decision 12: this table
isn't a `D3DCommon` consumer, doesn't touch any other backend or `GpuDrawParams`). `D3D9_Common`
extended to 29/29 for the new layout. The vertex-color variant (`VSInputTx2Vc`, 32 bytes) still
collides with the existing Position+Normal+TexCoord layout and stays undrawable — same category as
`BasicEffect`'s own `D9-82b` gaps. `texture1`/`DiffuseColor`/`FogVector`/`FogColor` reuse
`D9-82b`/`D9-82c`'s exact formulas verbatim, including the now-3-effects-shared
`ComputeFogVectorEXT()`. `D3D9_DrawEx` extended to 13/13: a new real check (`texture0`=white,
`texture1`=`(100,60,20)`, `DiffuseColor=(0.5,...)` → exact `(100,60,20,255)`, proving the real
doubling-blend formula end to end). Mutation-verified: skipped the `DiffuseColor` upload; exactly
the new check went red (the shared `c0` constant slot retained the PRIOR draw's `AlphaTestEffect`
value, giving a visibly wrong-but-plausible result — a real regression this test genuinely
catches); reverted, reconfirmed 13/13. (A `texture0`/`texture1`-slot-swap mutation was considered
but isn't distinguishable by 1×1 uniform-color textures — the real formula is algebraically
symmetric for constant-color inputs; judged out of scope.) Full D3D9 CTest suite (6 binaries)
passes.

`D9-82e`: new `D3D9GraphicsBackend::DrawEnvironmentMapEffectEXT()` (same file). **This row's own
"8 unblocked" estimate was exactly right**, unlike `D9-82b`/`D9-82d`'s own first-pass estimates:
`specularEnabled` is always `false` in this backend's own dispatch (same category as `BasicEffect`'s
`PreferPerPixelLighting`), making the 8 specular `ShaderIndex` values structurally unreachable, not
merely unimplemented — no separate throw branch needed. `VSInputNmTx` matches the EXISTING stride-32
layout exactly — no new vertex declaration needed here (unlike `D9-82d`). Factored the `oneLight`
derivation out of `DrawBasicEffectEXT()` into a shared `ComputeOneLightEXT()`, now used by both
`BasicEffect` and `EnvironmentMapEffect`. `EmissiveColor` needed NO reconstruction here (unlike
`BasicEffect`) — `EnvironmentMapEffect::FillGpuDrawParams()` already pre-folds
`(emissiveColor+ambient*diffuse)*alpha` itself, uploaded verbatim. `D3D9_DrawEx` extended to 15/15:
2 new real checks mirroring `BasicEffect`'s own Check C/D discipline (non-fresnel buckets only, for
hand-computable exactness) — "basic" bucket/2 lights (exact `(100,130,35)`) and `OneLight`
bucket/1 light (exact `(90,124,33)`, different from the first, proving correct bucket selection).
New 1×1 cube-map textures (`CreateTextureCube(1,false,0)`, all 6 faces the same color, sidesteps
needing to hand-compute `reflect()` geometry). Mutation-verified: forced the newly-shared
`ComputeOneLightEXT()` to always return `true`; BOTH `BasicEffect`'s own 2-light check AND
`EnvironmentMapEffect`'s new 2-light check went red simultaneously — the correct blast radius for a
genuinely shared helper; reverted, reconfirmed 15/15. Full D3D9 CTest suite (6 binaries) passes.

`D9-82f`: new `D3D9GraphicsBackend::DrawSkinnedEffectEXT()` + a new `UploadBonesVS()` helper (same
file). **This row's own "12 unblocked" estimate was exactly right, same as `D9-82e`'s.**
`VSInputNmTxWeights` matches the EXISTING stride-52 layout byte-for-byte — no new vertex
declaration needed. `preferPerPixelLighting` is always `false` (same `D9-81` item-1 gap as
`BasicEffect`), making the 6 pixel-lighting `ShaderIndex` values structurally unreachable — no
separate throw branch needed, mirroring `D9-82e`'s own finding. `Skin(vin, boneCount)` only
transforms Position/Normal before delegating to the SAME `ComputeCommonVSOutputWithLighting()`
`BasicEffect`'s lit path already uses, so `DiffuseColor`/lighting/fog need identical handling (no
new derivation logic); `EmissiveColor` is pre-folded exactly like `EnvironmentMapEffect`'s case.
Genuinely new: `Bones[72]` (`float4x3`, 216 registers, 3/bone) uses the EXACT SAME "first 3 columns
of the transposed matrix" packing `UploadMatrixConstantVS` already established for
`World`/`WorldInverseTranspose` (verified against FNA's own `EffectParameter.SetValue(Matrix)`
`ColumnCount==4/RowCount==3` branch directly), just repeated per-bone into one large
`SetVertexShaderConstantF` call. `D3D9_DrawEx` extended to 17/17: 2 new real checks mirror the
established bucket-selection discipline (vertex-lighting/2 lights → exact `(100,60,20)`;
`OneLight`/1 light → exact `(80,48,16)`), deliberately using a single Identity bone at 100% weight
(skinning is a no-op) so the expected math reduces to the same lit-textured formulas already
established, while still genuinely exercising the full `Bones[72]` upload path. Mutation-verified:
commented out the entire `UploadBonesVS()` call; BOTH new `SkinnedEffect` checks went red (an
untouched `Bones[0]` register left a zero skinning matrix, degenerating the triangle to a point),
every other effect's checks stayed green; reverted, reconfirmed 17/17. Full D3D9 CTest suite (6
binaries) passes.

`D9-83`: new `D3D9InstancedDraw.cpp` — `DrawInstancedPrimitivesEx` via `SetStreamSourceFreq`. Real
XNA 4.0 has no per-instance-aware Stock Effect vertex shader at all, so (matching D3D11/Vulkan/Bgfx's
own identical precedent) this does NOT dispatch through `D3D9EffectDraw.cpp` — it uses a fresh,
hand-authored NOXNA `vs_2_0`/`ps_2_0` shader (`shaders/cna/Instanced3D.hlsl`), compiled via `D9-71`'s
`fxc_tool.exe` and register-verified against a real `D3DDisassemble()` (`D9-72`'s `disasm_tool.exe`)
since it isn't a vendored Microsoft `.fx` file. New stride-64 2-stream vertex declaration (stream 0 =
`POSITION` geometry, stream 1 = `TEXCOORD1-4` per-instance world rows, matching D3D11's own 64-byte
per-instance convention). `SetStreamSourceFreq(0, D3DSTREAMSOURCE_INDEXEDDATA | instanceCount)` /
`SetStreamSourceFreq(1, D3DSTREAMSOURCE_INSTANCEDATA | 1)` follows the MSDN convention exactly; both
are reset to `1` before returning, since D3D9 stream-frequency state persists on the device and every
other draw path here reuses stream 0. `params.instanceVb == nullptr` falls back to
`DrawIndexedPrimitivesEx()`, matching D3D11's own identical fallback.

**Real bug found and fixed — in the new CTest's own pixel-sample coordinates, not the instancing
logic.** The first version of `D3D9_Instanced` sampled `(16,32)`/`(48,32)`, which sit exactly on the
45°-diagonal hypotenuse of the small right-triangle test geometry (confirmed by hand-deriving both
triangles' edge equations) — a rasterization-boundary case, not a rendering failure. A full-backbuffer
scan during debugging showed correctly-shaped, correctly-colored, correctly-positioned geometry was
already painting; only the two single-pixel probes were ill-chosen. Fixed by resampling at
`(14,34)`/`(46,34)`, comfortably inside each triangle's fill region. Every D3D9 API call involved
returned `S_OK` throughout — the shader/declaration/frequency setup was correct from the first working
build.

New `D3D9_Instanced` CTest, 4/4: two distinct instances (translations `-0.5`/`+0.5`) paint the shared
`DiffuseColor` at their own distinct locations in one draw call; `instanceVb==nullptr` reaches real
`BasicEffect` dispatch (not a stub) and throws for the expected reason; a normal
`DrawIndexedColoredPrimitives()` call issued right after the instanced draw still paints correctly,
proving the frequency reset is real. Mutation-verified: hardcoded the instance-count frequency to `1`;
exactly the 2nd-instance check went red, the other 3 stayed green; reverted, reconfirmed 4/4. Full
D3D9 CTest suite: 7/7 binaries pass. XNA 4.0's own instancing is `HiDef`-only — that profile gate is
still not enforced (Phase D9-10 closed `Texture2D` size ceilings but explicitly left this one open,
see that phase's own closure note).

**This closes real, verified dispatch for all 5 XNA Stock Effects plus hardware instancing on this
backend** — only `D9-84` (oracle validation) remains open in Phase D9-8.

### Phase D9-9 — SpriteBatch: D9-90/D9-91/D9-92/D9-93 CLOSED (D9-93 covers 3 of 5 SpriteSortMode values)

| Task | Status |
|---|---|
| `D9-90` — `D3D9SpriteBatchBackend` driving Microsoft's own `SpriteEffect` | ✅ |
| `D9-91` — the half-pixel offset, verified against the oracle | ✅ |
| `D9-92` — sampler filter/address-mode wiring with discriminating probe pixels | ✅ |
| `D9-93` — tested through the public API, diffed across all `SpriteSortMode`s | ✅ (3 of 5: `Deferred`/`BackToFront`/`FrontToBack`; `Immediate`/`Texture` explicitly scoped out) |

**Closed 2026-07-15 (`D9-90`/`D9-91`).** New `D3D9SpriteBatchBackend` (`include/`/`src/CNA/
Internal/Backends/D3D9/D3D9SpriteBatch.{hpp,cpp}`). `SpriteEffect.fx` was already vendored
verbatim (byte-identical to FNA's own copy) with compiled bytecode and a register table already
present in `d3d9_shaders.hpp`/`D3D9ShaderRegisters.hpp` — a side effect of the general D9-71/D9-72
compile sweep that ran across every vendored `.fx` file, not new work this task did. Vertex
contract reuses the EXISTING stride-24 `D3D9VertexDeclarations` layout unchanged (matches FNA's
own `VertexPositionColorTexture4` per-corner shape exactly — resolves D9-22's own "future concern"
about a stride-32 collision as moot, since sprite vertices are stride 24). CPU-side quad geometry
(destination/source rect, origin, rotation, `SpriteEffects` flip) reuses D3D11SpriteBatchBackend's
own already-proven formula verbatim. The genuinely D3D9-specific piece: `MatrixTransform` bakes
BOTH the SpriteBatch's own transform AND a D3D9 half-pixel correction into one real `float4x4`
uniform (`projection.M41 += -0.5*projection.M11; projection.M42 += -0.5*projection.M22`, applied
to a `CreateOrthographicOffCenter(0,W,H,0,0,1)` base) — matching how real XNA/FNA's own
`SpriteBatch.cs` structures this (Microsoft's real `SpriteEffect.fx` has a genuine matrix uniform,
unlike D3D11's own CNA-invented shader which has none).

Verified via 3 new `D9-A5` oracle scenes (`sprite_basic_quad`/`sprite_rotated_quad`/
`sprite_flipped_quad`, all `0/65536` pixel-perfect against real XNA 4.0 on the first attempt) and
a new `D3D9_SpriteBatch` CTest (4/4 checks).

**Real, non-obvious finding surfaced while mutation-testing the half-pixel offset**: a 1×1-texture
scene and quadrant-CENTER sample points are BOTH structurally incapable of detecting this offset
at all — the classic D3D9 half-pixel bug shifts which TEXTURE CONTENT a screen pixel samples, not
where a rectangle's geometric edges land, and a 1×1 texture has only one texel regardless of any
sub-pixel shift. Discovered by commenting out the `M41`/`M42` lines and re-running: the boundary
check and quadrant-center checks stayed green even with the offset entirely removed (a false-
positive "closed" trap), while the SAME mutation made the two 2×2-four-color-texture oracle scenes
diverge from real XNA by `4800/65536` pixels — proving the offset genuinely matters. Fixed by
adding a dedicated CTest check sampling exactly on the internal texel boundary the flip scene's
own draw produces (confirmed this exact pixel shifts from `(130,125,0)` to `(128,128,0)` under the
mutation, every other check staying green); re-verified 4/4 green with the real implementation
restored, all 21 corpus scenes re-verified pixel-perfect, full `D3D9` CTest suite 12/12 green.

**Closed 2026-07-15 (`D9-92`).** `SetSamplerFilter()`/`SetSamplerAddressMode()` already plumbed
through to the real, already-proven `D9-63` `ApplySamplerState()` path — the missing piece was
purely test coverage, since `Begin()` with no arguments only ever exercises the default
`LinearClamp`. Extended the scene format with `spritesourcerect`/`spritesampler` keys and
`SpriteBatch::Begin(sortMode, blendState, samplerState, null, null)` wiring on both sides. Two new
`D9-A5` scenes, both pixel-perfect on the first attempt: `sprite_wrap_quad` (`PointWrap`, a 2×1
RED/GREEN texture sampled with a `sourceRectangle` DOUBLE the texture's own width — tiles the
pattern `RED,GREEN,RED,GREEN` across 4 destination bands) and `sprite_mirror_quad` (a manually
constructed Point/Mirror `SamplerState` — real XNA has no named `PointMirror` preset — same
texture/geometry, folds SYMMETRICALLY around the `U=1` boundary instead: `RED,GREEN,GREEN,RED`,
genuinely distinguishable from `Wrap`'s tiled pattern using identical source data). Both formulas
independently predicted before running either side, then confirmed pixel-for-pixel identical. 2
new checks added to `D3D9_SpriteBatch` (now 6/6). All 24 corpus scenes re-verified pixel-perfect;
full `D3D9` CTest suite 12/12 green.

**Closed 2026-07-15 (`D9-93`), for 3 of 5 `SpriteSortMode` values — `Immediate`/`Texture`
explicitly scoped out, not silently assumed.** Design: 2 overlapping `NonPremultiplied`-blended
sprites (RED tint `(255,0,0,128)` depth=0.0, GREEN tint `(0,255,0,128)` depth=1.0, identical
destination rectangle) — `AlphaBlend` expects premultiplied colors and would give the wrong math
for these raw alpha=128 tints regardless of draw order, so the multi-sprite path switches to
`NonPremultiplied`. 3 new `D9-A5` scenes: `sprite_sortmode_deferred_quad` (insertion order
RED-then-GREEN, GREEN ends up on top, green-dominant `(64,128,0,159)`),
`sprite_sortmode_backtofront_quad` (same insertion order, reordered far-to-near so RED ends up on
top instead, red-dominant `(128,64,0,159)`), `sprite_sortmode_fronttoback_quad` (insertion order
deliberately REVERSED to GREEN-then-RED, so the ascending reorder is genuinely discriminating — it
still puts GREEN on top, matching the Deferred scene's value despite the opposite insertion order,
proving the reorder is by `layerDepth` and not merely insertion order). All 3 pixel-perfect against
real XNA 4.0 once the bug below was fixed. 3 new checks added to `D3D9_SpriteBatch` (now 9/9),
exact-value assertions matching every other check in this file.

**A real, previously-undetected D3D9 backend bug was found and fixed via this task.** Every prior
D9-90/91/92 scene only ever drew with `layerDepth=0.0f`, so `D3D9SpriteBatchBackend::
BuildMatrixTransformEXT`'s own Z-row math was never exercised before now. Its projection used
`CreateOrthographicOffCenter(0,W,H,0,0, zFarPlane=1)`, giving `M33=1/(zNear-zFar)=-1, M43=0` — i.e.
`Z' = -layerDepth` — which maps ANY `layerDepth > 0` outside Direct3D 9's valid `[0,1]` clip-space
Z range, silently clipping the sprite away entirely (confirmed NOT a depth-test artifact:
`DepthStencilState.None` — `ZENABLE=FALSE` — was already correctly in effect; clip-space culling
is a separate, unconditional rasterizer stage). Root-caused by rendering the same scene through the
real XNA 4.0 oracle FIRST and finding it produced the fully-correct blended values while CNA
produced nothing but the RED sprite (the GREEN sprite was being clipped in every case, making
`Deferred` and `BackToFront` render identically — the actual first symptom noticed, before the
cause was understood). Fixed with `zFarPlane=-1` instead, giving an identity Z-row (`M33=1,
M43=0`, so `Z'=layerDepth`, unclipped) — only the Z row changes, the already-verified X/Y
half-pixel math (`D9-91`) depends solely on `M11`/`M22` and is unaffected. Mutation-tested
(reverted to `zFarPlane=1`, confirmed the sort-mode checks then extant FAILED while every other
check stayed green, then restored and reconfirmed all green) per this project's own established
discipline (`D9-91`'s own mutation-testing precedent). All 27 corpus scenes re-verified
pixel-perfect after the fix; full `D3D9` CTest suite 12/12 green.

**Explicitly NOT covered, not silently assumed**: `SpriteSortMode.Immediate` — its only real
behavioral difference from `Deferred` (per-`Draw()` GPU submission instead of batching until
`End()`) is not pixel-observable by this project's oracle methodology (a batched multi-quad draw
call and N individual draw calls in the same order produce the same final raster image), so a
scene for it would not add verification value beyond what `Deferred` already proves.
`SpriteSortMode.Texture` — confirmed NOT a viable oracle scene, not merely deferred: real FNA's
own `SpriteBatch.cs` `TextureComparer.Compare` sorts by `texture.GetHashCode()`, i.e. `Texture`'s
inherited default `Object.GetHashCode()` — an implementation-defined identity hash with no
documented, predictable ordering between two arbitrary textures. Any 2-distinct-texture test's
"which texture group ends up on top" result is genuinely non-deterministic from a black-box
test-authoring perspective (not just hard to hand-derive), so no scene for it can meet this
project's own `--tolerance 0` exact-match discipline reliably.

**Multi-texture batching / a genuine `FlushBatch()`-on-texture-change mid-batch CLOSED 2026-07-15**
(D9-90's own explicitly-named gap, closed as a `D9-A5` scene-corpus addition, not a new Phase D9-9
task ID): new `sprite_multitexture_quad.scene` — 3 non-overlapping sprites, interleaved
RED-texture/BLUE-texture/RED-texture (not RED-RED-BLUE, so the SECOND red draw genuinely forces a
SECOND rebind after the blue draw's own flush) — reuses the scene format's existing `texture2*`
keys plus a new optional trailing `textureIndex` column on `spritedraw=` lines. `0/65536`
pixel-perfect against real XNA 4.0 on the first attempt; mutation-verified (disabled the
texture-change flush trigger, confirmed the middle sprite's BLUE leaked into the third position —
`1600/65536` pixels wrong — then restored and reconfirmed green). New `D3D9_SpriteBatch` Check I
(now 10/10). All 28 corpus scenes re-verified pixel-perfect; full `D3D9` CTest suite 12/12 green.

### Phase D9-10 — `GraphicsProfile` made real: D9-100–D9-105 all CLOSED

| Task | Status |
|---|---|
| `D9-100` — research: XNA 4.0 Reach/HiDef capability floors, mapped onto `D3DCAPS9` fields | ✅ |
| `D9-101` — `GraphicsAdapter::IsProfileSupported()` real on D3D9 | ✅ |
| `D9-102` — `QueryRenderTargetFormat()`/`QueryBackBufferFormat()` real on D3D9 | ✅ |
| `D9-103` — profile enforced at resource creation (`Texture2D` size ceilings) | ✅ |
| `D9-104` — tests: a Reach-illegal request refused, the HiDef equivalent allowed | ✅ |
| `D9-105` — DXVK-synthesized `D3DCAPS9` caveat documented | ✅ |

**Closed 2026-07-15.** Researched via FNA's own `ProfileCapabilities.cs` (`D9-100`'s own table),
cross-checked against Shawn Hargreaves' (XNA team lead) official blog post
`reach-vs-hidef.html`. **Critical finding: `ProfileCapabilities` is dead code in FNA** —
referenced only inside its own file, never consulted by any `Texture2D`/`GraphicsDevice`
constructor or method anywhere in FNA. `GraphicsAdapter.IsProfileSupported()` is FNA's own
unconditional `return true;` with a literal `TODO` (flibit: "This method could be genuinely
useful!"). **FNA therefore has no enforcement BEHAVIOR to port — only the capability NUMBERS are
usable; the validation/throwing logic is this project's own design.** One real discrepancy found
and resolved: FNA's own HiDef table (`MaxTextureSize`/`MaxCubeSize`/`MaxVolumeExtent` =
8192/8192/2048, commented "DX10 min spec") is an *observed hardware ceiling*, not the Hargreaves
blog's own documented HiDef *floor* (4096/4096/256) — this implementation uses the documented
floor, since "capability floor" (the task's own title) means the minimum a profile guarantees,
not an observed ceiling on stronger-than-required hardware. No MSAA level table or instancing
requirement exists anywhere in XNA's own published Reach/HiDef spec — a genuine absence, not an
FNA omission; both stay hardware-queried, not profile-gated.

New `include/`/`src/CNA/Internal/Backends/D3D9/D3D9ProfileCapabilities.{hpp,cpp}`:
`QueryAdapterCapsEXT()` probes real `D3DCAPS9` via `IDirect3D9::GetDeviceCaps()` WITHOUT
constructing a live device (the same pre-device-creation pattern `D3D9GraphicsBackend`'s own
constructor already uses); `MeetsHiDefFloorEXT()` checks the hardware-queryable subset of the
table; `IsRenderTargetFormatSupportedByHardwareEXT()`/`IsBackBufferFormatSupportedByHardwareEXT()`
use `CheckDeviceFormat`/`CheckDeviceType` respectively (the swap chain has stricter
display-compatibility rules than an ordinary render-target texture, D9-30's own finding);
`ClampMultiSampleCountForFormatEXT()` reimplements `D3D9GraphicsBackend::
ClampMultiSampleCountEXT()`'s own `CheckDeviceMultiSampleType` pattern as a free function.
`GraphicsAdapter.cpp`'s three methods wired under `#ifdef CNA_BACKEND_D3D9` — backend-local, the
other 9 backends keep their honest `return true;`/hardcoded-fallback in the `#else` branch
(matches `GraphicsDevice.cpp`'s own `#ifdef CNA_BACKEND_BGFX` precedent for backend-conditional
code in a shared XNA-layer file). `Texture2D`'s two `GraphicsDevice&` constructors now throw
`System::NotSupportedException` (checked BEFORE any pixel allocation) when the requested size
exceeds the profile's own ceiling (2048 Reach / 4096 HiDef) — a profile CEILING, not a hardware
query, regardless of what the device could otherwise support.

**A real, previously-undetected bug was found and fixed along the way, in SHARED cross-backend
code, not D3D9-specific**: `Game`'s own `GraphicsDevice_` member is eagerly default-constructed
(hardcoded `GraphicsProfile::Reach`) BEFORE `GraphicsDeviceManager` even exists, and
`GraphicsDeviceManager::applyToExistingBackend()` threaded a requested profile change into a
transient `GraphicsDeviceInformation` but never wrote it back onto the already-live device before
`Reset()` — a real game's own `graphics.GraphicsProfile = GraphicsProfile.HiDef;
graphics.ApplyChanges();` had **no path to ever reach the actual device**, and
`GraphicsDevice.GraphicsProfile` silently kept reporting `Reach` regardless. This directly
blocked this whole phase's own premise (a profile distinction reachable through the real public
API, not just `D3D9_Smoke` Check K's own backend-direct construction). Fixed with a new NOXNA
`GraphicsDevice::SetGraphicsProfileEXT()`, called from `applyToExistingBackend()` right before
`Reset()`. Cross-backend regression-checked: EasyGL's own `CnaTests`
(`GraphicsAdapterTest`/`GraphicsDeviceDefaultStateTest`/`Texture2DTest`, 70 cases) all still pass
— the fix only makes `graphicsProfile_` correctly track what was requested; no backend besides
D3D9 branches on it at all.

New `D3D9_GraphicsProfile` CTest (`examples/d3d9_graphicsprofile_test.cpp`, 10/10 checks), through
the real public `GraphicsAdapter`/`Game`/`GraphicsDeviceManager`/`Texture2D` API. The required
"Reach-illegal request refused, HiDef equivalent allowed" pair uses
`QueryRenderTargetFormat(_, SurfaceFormat.Single, ...)` (genuinely HiDef-only per the researched
table) rather than this row's own suggested NPOT-wrap example — NPOT-wrap-on-`Reach` was
deliberately set aside (see below). All checks mutation-verified (the `SetGraphicsProfileEXT`
propagation fix and `MaxTextureSizeForProfileEXT`, each independently disabled, correctly failed
their own targeted checks and nothing else, then restored). Full `D3D9` CTest suite 13/13 green.

**D9-105's own honest caveat, restated (not just in `plan_dx9.md`)**: every `D3DCAPS9`-consuming
function here is REAL logic against a REAL `IDirect3D9`/`IDirect3DDevice9` — but in this Wine+DXVK
dev loop, the `D3DCAPS9` VALUES those calls return are DXVK's own synthesized capability set, not
what an authentic XNA-era (~2006-2013) Direct3D 9 driver would report. `IsProfileSupported(HiDef)`
returning `true` here proves the comparison LOGIC is correct, not that a real HiDef-class GPU
exists in this loop (it doesn't). Provisional until `D9-140` (real Windows hardware,
`needs_human`).

**Follow-up CLOSED 2026-07-15: `TextureCube`/`Texture3D` size ceilings and `MaxRenderTargets`
enforcement.** All three reuse `D3D9ProfileCapabilities`' own already-written helpers (no new
capability logic, just wiring): `TextureCube` throws past 512 (Reach)/4096 (HiDef);
`Texture3D` throws UNCONDITIONALLY under Reach (volume textures unsupported at all, not merely
size-capped) and past 256 under HiDef; `GraphicsDevice::SetRenderTargets()` throws past 1 target
under Reach (4 under HiDef) — a separate, lower, software-imposed ceiling from
`MAX_RENDERTARGET_BINDINGS` (XNA's general 4-target cap) and from `D9-54`'s own hardware-cap
enforcement inside the backend. 8 new checks (`D3D9_GraphicsProfile` now 19/19), same
"same request refused under Reach, allowed under HiDef" pattern, mutation-verified (disabled all
3 new profile-ceiling functions at once, confirmed exactly the 6 tied checks — 3 per profile —
went red, restored). Regression-checked again on EasyGL (150 relevant `CnaTests` cases, all
green). Full `D3D9` CTest suite 13/13 green.

**Explicitly NOT covered, not silently assumed**: hardware-instancing's own real HiDef-only gate
(noted as a Phase D9-10 follow-up back when `D9-83` closed, still open); and NPOT-wrap-on-`Reach`
(D9-56's own originally-deferred example) — real XNA's own enforcement timing/behavior here is
undocumented, and FNA implements none of it either (confirmed by `D9-100`'s own research), so
inventing one without a reference would risk asserting behavior this project cannot actually
verify against real XNA. Both real, honest follow-ups, not claimed done.

### Phase D9-11 — Custom `ShaderEffect`: AUTHORIZED 2026-07-15, FULLY CLOSED same day

New `D3D9ConstantTable.{hpp,cpp}` (`ParseConstantTableEXT()`): a real CTAB (constant table) binary
parser reading Microsoft's own `D3DXSHADER_CONSTANTTABLE`/`D3DXSHADER_CONSTANTINFO` structures
directly out of compiled D3D9 shader bytecode, no `ID3DXConstantTable`/D3DX linkage anywhere
(design decision 9). Needed because, unlike D3D11's own fixed-slot `D3D11EffectBackend` convention
(HLSL cbuffer offsets are caller-predictable), D3D9 constant *registers* are assigned by the
compiler and can vary — only a real post-compile name→register lookup is reliable.

New `D3D9_ConstantTable` CTest (`examples/d3d9_constanttable_test.cpp`, 14/14): compiles a known
3-constant test shader via the real `D3DCompile()`, then cross-checks the parser's output against
`D3DDisassemble()`'s own independent `"// Registers:"` text block (same regex
`extract_shader_registers.py`, `D9-72`, already uses) rather than trusting the binary parser
blindly. **Found and fixed a real bug this way**: the first attempt returned 0 constants — a debug
byte-dump against real compiler output found every offset field inside the CTAB structures is
relative to 4 bytes *past* the `'CTAB'` FourCC (where `Size` begins), not the FourCC itself.
Mutation-verified (reverted to the wrong offset base — parser reads the shader-version-token field
as an absurd constant count and crashes with `std::bad_alloc`; reverted, reconfirmed 14/14 green).
Added a defensive sanity bound so malformed/corrupted CTAB data returns empty rather than crashing.
Full `D3D9` CTest suite now 15/15.

**`D9-111` CLOSED**: new `D3D9EffectBackend.{hpp,cpp}` (`IEffectBackend`) — real runtime
`D3DCompile()` (`vs_2_0`/`ps_2_0` Reach, `vs_3_0`/`ps_3_0` HiDef), `SetUniform*` genuinely looks
`name` up per-stage via `D9-110`'s own real register tables (not D3D11EffectBackend's fixed-slot
convention — D3D9 registers are compiler-assigned and vary per shader). Build-isolated per design
decision 16: excluded from the main backend source glob, built as its own
`cna_backend_graphics_d3d9_effect` static library with `d3dcompiler` linked ONLY there — the stock
D3D9 pipeline stays dependency-free, a real divergence from D3D11/D3D12's own simpler "link it to
the whole backend" precedent. New `D3D9_EffectBackend` CTest (6/6), matching D3D11EffectBackend's
own `DX-58` test bar exactly (compile + bind + draw + uniform-driven pixel readback) on a real
device. **Real finding via mutation-testing**: the original single "far-away WorldViewProj leaves
background unpainted" check wasn't actually discriminating — an entirely-disabled vertex-constant
upload ALSO leaves the register at zero, which ALSO degenerates the triangle to nothing, for a
completely different (broken) reason. Fixed by splitting into a positive-case anchor (identity
re-upload must still paint red) immediately before the negative case; re-mutated and confirmed the
anchor now correctly fails first. Full D3D9 CTest suite now 16/16.

**`D9-112` CLOSED — `SpriteBatch::Begin(effect)` wiring, Phase D9-11 now FULLY CLOSED.** New
`D3D9SpriteBatchBackend::SetCustomEffect()` (flush-on-change, mirrors D3D11's identical pattern).
`FlushBatch()` branches on a valid custom `D3D9EffectBackend`: uploads viewport size to a
`"vpSize"` uniform (reusing `D9-111`'s own generic `SetUniformVec2()` directly — no dedicated
method needed, unlike D3D11's `SetViewportSizeEXT()`, since D3D9's real per-name lookup has no
fixed-slot limitation to work around), calls `Apply()` then `Bind()`, replacing the stock
shader/`MatrixTransform` block. Vertex declaration/texture/sampler binding stay unchanged between
paths — genuinely simpler than D3D11 (whose `InputLayout` is baked into specific shader bytecode)
since D3D9's declaration is a decoupled device state. New `D3D9GraphicsBackend::CreateEffectBackend()`
and the matching `CMakeLists.txt` circular-link fix (D3D9 joins the `CNA`-back-link `OR` chain,
closing the gap `D9-10`'s own row deferred here).

**Real, previously-invisible bug found and fixed**: moving `D3D9EffectBackend.cpp` out of the main
backend glob while `D3D9ConstantTable.cpp` stayed in it created a genuine link-order circular
dependency between the two new targets — every D3D9 test binary failed with `undefined reference
to ParseConstantTableEXT`. Root-caused: `D3D9ConstantTable.cpp` has no consumer outside
`D3D9EffectBackend.cpp`, so it moved into the isolated effect target too, eliminating the cycle.

New `D3D9_SpriteBatch_CustomEffect` CTest (4/4), through the real public `SpriteBatch`/`ShaderEffect`
API, mirroring D3D11's own `DX-71` test bar (a runtime-compiled RGB-inversion shader replaces the
stock pipeline for a batch) in real D3D9 SM2/SM3 HLSL syntax. All 4 passed on the first successful
build. Mutation-verified: forced the custom-effect branch unreachable, confirmed exactly the
color-inversion discriminator failed while position/restore-to-stock checks correctly stayed green
(the stock path still draws in the right place, just uninverted — expected, not a test gap);
reverted clean. Full D3D9 CTest suite now 17/17; EasyGL/`CnaTests` regression-checked (491/491+,
`*SpriteBatch*` filter 36/36) — every CMake change scoped inside `CNA_GRAPHICS_BACKEND STREQUAL
"D3D9"` guards.

### Phase D9-12 — the indistinguishability suite: ALL CLOSED (D9-120/D9-121/D9-122/D9-123)

| Task | Status |
|---|---|
| `D9-120` — promote `D9-A`'s corpus to a real, checked-in-reference-image CTest | ✅ |
| `D9-121` — a written, honest divergence report | ✅ |
| `D9-122` — `D3D9_Smoke`/`D3D9_Common` + the 4 reused state tests, mutation-verified | ✅ |
| `D9-123` — `CnaTests` under `CNA_GRAPHICS_BACKEND=D3D9` | ✅ (both the setenv compile blocker and the follow-up `gtest_discover_tests` CTest-registration blocker fixed and verified, see below) |

**Closed 2026-07-15 (`D9-120`/`D9-121`).** All 31 `D9-A5` scenes' real-XNA-4.0 renders regenerated
FRESH (not trusted from an earlier cached run) and confirmed byte-identical (SHA-256) to the
already-cached versions before checking them in at `tools/xna-oracle/reference/*.png` (132 KB
total). New `scripts/run-oracle-corpus-diff.sh` renders each scene via `cna_oracle_render.exe`
through the existing D3D9 Wine wrapper (**not** the XNA one) and diffs against the checked-in
reference at `tolerance=0`. New `D3D9_XNA_Diff` CTest — full D3D9 suite now 14/14, ~88s for the
complete 31-scene sweep, zero XNA-prefix dependency at test-run time. Mutation-verified: corrupted
one checked-in reference pixel, confirmed the script reports exactly that scene FAIL (with the
real delta) and exits 1, restored, reconfirmed 31/31 green.

New `docs/d3d9-divergence-report.md` — headline result **0/31 scenes diverge from real XNA 4.0 at
tolerance=0**, with an explicit table of what the corpus does NOT yet cover (so the empty-list
result isn't mistaken for total coverage) and an honest, current-status re-read of all six
project-wide CNA-vs-XNA divergences `plan_dx9.md`'s own section names: Divergence 3
(`GraphicsProfile` decorative) is now CLOSED on D3D9 (Phase D9-10); Divergence 4 (`SpriteBatch`
half-texel convention never modeled) is now MEASURED AND CONFIRMED CORRECT on D3D9 (`D9-91`);
Divergences 1/5/6 remain genuinely unmeasured or only partially measured; Divergence 2 is resolved
for D3D9's own dispatch correctness only. Also documents the 2 real backend bugs this whole
measurement effort found and fixed (`D9-93`'s `SpriteSortMode` Z-clipping; Phase D9-10's own
`GraphicsProfile`-never-reaches-the-device bug) as evidence the methodology finds real problems.

**Closed 2026-07-15 (`D9-122`).** Read every task's closure note that produced a `D3D9_Smoke`/
`D3D9_Common` check (`D9-23`, `D9-30`–`D9-64`, `D9-82`/`D9-83`, Phase D9-10) and classified each
check CONFIRMED (explicit mutation-test evidence on record) or GAP (never deliberately broken).
Ran 6 new mutation cycles against the highest-priority GAPs — each: break the implementation →
rebuild `cna_test_d3d9_smoke` → confirm EXACTLY the predicted check(s) go red and nothing else →
revert → rebuild → reconfirm `55/55`:

1. `ApplyBlendState()`'s `D3DRS_DESTBLEND` forced to `D3DBLEND_ONE` — first-ever mutation proof for
   `D3D9_BlendState_Opaque`/`D3D9_BlendState_AlphaBlend`.
2. `PerformResetRecovery()`'s `deviceLost_ = false;` disabled — Check M's own recovery assertion
   failed as predicted, and surfaced a genuine finding (not a bug): the very next line in Check M
   is a bare `dev.Clear(...)` with no try/catch, so a still-lost device throws an uncaught
   `DeviceLostException` and crashes the whole test binary (exit 3) before Checks N–Z ever run — a
   broken device-lost recovery doesn't fail one check, it takes the rest of the suite down with it.
3. `SetRenderTargets()`'s per-slot bind loop hardcoded to slot 0 — failed only Check V's "both
   targets get the exact color" assertion; the pre-existing "over-request throws" and "unbind
   restores back buffer" halves stayed correctly unaffected.
4. `D3D9RenderTargetBackend::BindAsRenderTarget()`'s `SetRenderTarget(0, ...)` disabled — failed
   both Check S (baseline, previously UNVERIFIED) and Check U (MSAA), Check T (cube) correctly
   unaffected, confirming 2D/cube code-path isolation.
5. `D3D9VertexBufferBackend::Upload()`'s `memcpy` swapped for a zeroing `memset` — failed Check N
   (baseline round-trip, previously UNVERIFIED), Check P (device-lost buffer recovery), and
   cascaded into Check Z's two `SetDepthTestEnabled` assertions (expected — Check Z's quads come
   from `SetData()`-uploaded buffers, a real transitive dependency, not a false positive).
6. `D3D9TextureCubeBackend::SetData()`'s row-copy `memcpy` swapped for zeroing — failed only Check
   R's cube-face round-trip assertion (previously UNVERIFIED).

All 6 reverted (`git diff --stat` confirmed zero-diff each time), full `D3D9_Smoke` reconfirmed
`55/55` after every cycle. **Explicitly NOT mutation-tested, real remaining gaps, not silently
assumed covered**: Check Y's `MAGFILTER`/`MIPFILTER`/`ADDRESSV` fields (deprioritized — same
combined boolean assertion as the already-CONFIRMED `ADDRESSU`); Check R's volume-texture half
(only the cube half was tested); `D3D9_Smoke` Checks B/C/D–I/J/L; `D3D9_Common`'s other 29 of 30
checks (only 1 `CullMode`-mapping check has explicit evidence, judged lower-priority — homogeneous
lookup-table checks, method already proven on one representative entry). Full detail in
`plan_dx9.md`'s own `D9-122` row.

**`D9-123` — FULLY CLOSED 2026-07-15, both the compile blocker and its own downstream follow-up.**
The POSIX `::setenv()`/`::unsetenv()` wall (`AudioEngineTests.cpp`/`WaveBankTests.cpp`/
`CueTests.cpp` and 10 other files) is resolved — all 62 call sites replaced with
`System::Environment::SetEnvironmentVariable` (`sharp-runtime`, already MinGW-proven). `CnaTests`
now compiles and links cleanly under `CNA_GRAPHICS_BACKEND=D3D9` for the first time ever.

That fix surfaced a second, previously-unreachable blocker: `gtest_discover_tests` tried to
execute the cross-compiled `CnaTests.exe` directly to enumerate test names, and a PE32+ Windows
binary can't run natively on Linux without a Wine `CMAKE_CROSSCOMPILING_EMULATOR` — invisible
before since the binary never compiled far enough to reach this step. Measured the naive fix's
real cost first (a single Wine spawn costs ~1.2s; the discovered suite has 4367 individual test
cases, so spawning each separately would cost ~87 minutes of pure process overhead) before picking
an approach. Fixed by setting `CROSSCOMPILING_EMULATOR` on the `CnaTests` target (the same
CMake-native mechanism `DX-80`'s own `cna_d3d11_ctest_command` macro already uses for D3D11/D3D12's
own CTests), selecting the correct per-backend Wine wrapper with its DXVK/vkd3d-proton
authenticity gate deliberately disabled (`CnaTests` spans non-Graphics namespaces that never open
a device, so that gate would misreport every one of those as a fake fallback). This also
automatically fixed `CnaInputTests`' own separate `add_test` registration a few lines below, with
no code change needed there. Deliberately did NOT redesign test granularity — the project's real
workflow (`ctest -L D3D9`) label-filters, and none of the 4367 discovered cases carry that label,
so they're registered but never actually invoked by the normal command; the 87-minute concern only
applies to a hypothetical unfiltered full run.

**Verified end-to-end, not just "no longer crashes"**: `ctest -L D3D9` — 14/14 pass, no more
test-file-generation crash; `ctest -N` shows 4383 total registered tests; explicitly ran 2
individual discovered cases plus `CnaInputTests` itself via `ctest -R` — all genuinely execute
through Wine and pass. **EasyGL regression-checked**: reconfigured + rebuilt, ran the same 2
spot-checks natively — pass at native speed, `CMAKE_CROSSCOMPILING` guard correctly no-ops for the
9 already-established non-cross backends. Not independently re-verified on D3D11/D3D12's own build
dirs (not configured in this worktree); full detail in `plan_dx9.md`'s `D9-123` row.

### Phase D9-13 — docs: `D9-130` CLOSED, `D9-140` still open (`needs_human`)

New `docs/d3d9-backend.md` — leads with what this backend is *for* (XNA pixel authenticity, not
feature parity), the fact that it runs Microsoft's own vendored Stock Effects HLSL bytecode, and
the 0/31-divergence oracle result, before any "known limitations" list. A full `D3D9` column was
added across all 7 tables in `docs/graphics-backend-feature-matrix.md` (2D SpriteBatch/SpriteFont,
Stock Effects, RenderTarget/MSAA/mip/depth, Texture2D/3D/Cube, GraphicsDevice state objects,
OcclusionQuery, Model) plus a new "Remaining genuine D3D9 limitations" section, matching the
existing Vulkan/Bgfx precedent. Every cell was grounded by actually reading
`tools/xna-oracle/scenes/*.scene` rather than recalled from memory (e.g. confirmed exactly which
`SpriteSortMode`/`AlphaTestEffect.AlphaFunction`/`WeightsPerVertex` values have a dedicated scene,
and that `EnvironmentMapEffect.specularEnabled` is structurally unreachable on this backend's
current dispatch, `D9-82e`) — cells that couldn't be grounded this way are honestly `⬜`/`🟨`, not
assumed `✅`. `README.md` gained a `D3D9` Project-Status bullet, a "Build (Windows
cross-compilation — D3D9 backend)" section mirroring D3D11/D3D12's, and a Tested-Compilers row.
`programs.md` §9 gained the D3D9-specific three-Wine-prefix subsection this document's own
`plan_dx9.md` line 103 had flagged as a gap (`programs.md` previously documented only the D3D11
prefix). `D9-140` (real Windows hardware) remains open, `needs_human`, unchanged.

### Does NOT work yet

`BasicEffect`'s `PreferPerPixelLighting` variants, `EnvironmentMapEffect`'s specular variants, and
`SkinnedEffect`'s `PreferPerPixelLighting` variants (all blocked on `D9-81`'s still-open
`GpuDrawParams` gaps), and any `BasicEffect`/`DualTextureEffect`/`EnvironmentMapEffect`/
`SkinnedEffect` combination with no matching CNA vertex layout (`D9-82b`/`D9-82d`'s own
enumerations) — all still throw a named not-yet-implemented naming their own follow-up task, by
design. `SpriteBatch` now has a real, oracle-verified `D3D9SpriteBatchBackend` (Phase D9-9,
`D9-90`–`D9-93` all CLOSED, see that phase's own section above) — no longer belongs in this list.
`BasicEffect`'s realistically-drawable 10 `ShaderIndex` values, all 8 of
`AlphaTestEffect`'s, 2 of `DualTextureEffect`'s 4, all 8 non-specular of `EnvironmentMapEffect`'s
16, all 12 non-pixel-lighting of `SkinnedEffect`'s 18, and the narrow
`DrawColoredPrimitives`/`DrawIndexedColoredPrimitives` path are real — every XNA Stock Effect has a
real dispatch path now. The mapping tables (`D9-20`–`23`) are now consumed by the render-state push path,
the buffer-creation path, the texture/render-target-creation paths, and the draw path itself.

## 3. Recent changes

Most recent first. Full detail lives in `plan_dx9.md` — this is a short index.

| Commit(s) | Summary |
|---|---|
| *(pending)* | **RESOLVED the documented render-target-as-texture D3D9 crash from `08aba091`/§4 — a real CNA bug, not a DXVK/environment limitation.** Root cause: every `D3D9EffectDraw.cpp` texture-binding call site did `static_cast<const D3D9TextureBackend*>(params.texture0)` unconditionally, which is undefined behavior whenever `params.texture0` actually points at a `D3D9RenderTargetBackend` (a real, legal runtime type for that `const ITextureBackend*` field, since `IRenderTargetBackend : ITextureBackend`) — exactly what happens when a `RenderTarget2D` is sampled as an ordinary effect texture. `D3D11GraphicsBackend.cpp` already solves this exact problem (`GetSrvForTextureEXT`, a two-concrete-type `dynamic_cast` resolver) — `D3D9` never had the equivalent. Fixed with new `ResolveD3D9TextureEXT`/`ResolveD3D9TextureCubeEXT` helpers (mirroring D3D11's own precedent) replacing all 6 unsafe `static_cast` sites in `D3D9EffectDraw.cpp`, plus the same fix in `D3D9SpriteBatch.cpp`'s own analogous (already `dynamic_cast`-safe, non-crashing but silently-wrong) gap. **Mutation-verified**: temporarily reintroduced the exact original `static_cast`, reproduced the documented symptom verbatim (`terminate called after throwing an instance of 'dxvk::DxvkError'`); reverted, reconfirmed the fix. New `D3D9_DrawEx` Check Q (18 checks): a `D3D9RenderTargetBackend` created/bound/`Clear()`ed/unbound then sampled directly as an ordinary `BasicEffect` texture — exact readback, no crash. Full `ctest -L D3D9`: 17/17 green, zero regressions. Deliberately did not re-attempt the reverted oracle-corpus scene (`D9-A5`/`D9-84`'s own territory) as part of this fix. See §4's own updated record and `plan_dx9.md`'s `D9-84` row. |
| *(pending)* | **`D9-A6` CLOSED — the oracle corpus run against a SECOND backend (EasyGL) for the first time ever.** Confirmed `tools/xna-oracle/CnaOracleRender.cpp` was already backend-agnostic before touching it (only two `printf` strings and one comment literally said `D3D9`) — added a small `OracleBackendName()` helper keyed off the `CNA_BACKEND_*` compile definitions, no other line changed. New, purely-additive `cna_easygl_test(cna_oracle_render_easygl ...)` CMake registration inside the existing EasyGL-tests section (not a CTest, same "comparison tool" precedent as `cna_oracle_render`); new non-Wine `scripts/run-oracle-corpus-diff-easygl.sh` twin driver script. Existing D3D9 registration/CTest/script untouched (`cmake --build cmake-build-d3d9 --target cna_oracle_render` re-verified still green after the change). **Result: 10/31 pixel-perfect (all `sprite_*` + `alphatest_never_quad`), 21/31 diverge in three evidenced patterns** — (1) 17 scenes diverge only in a thin silhouette-edge band (rasterization fill-rule/pixel-center convention gap vs. D3D9-over-DXVK, most likely), notably including 5 "lit" scenes that turn out structurally incapable of exposing the predicted `preferPerPixelLighting` gap (uniform normal/light by construction); (2) 2 scenes (`colored3d`, `colored_trianglestrip_quad`) diverge almost everywhere but by only 1-3/channel — ordinary Mesa/RADV-vs-DXVK float rounding noise, not a bug; (3) 2 real, previously-unmeasured `plan_graphics.md` candidates — `fog_gradient_quad` renders fully-fogged/black everywhere (including the near/unfogged edge) instead of the correct linear gradient (likely a negative-`FogEnd`-specific EasyGL bug), and `envmap_fresnel_quad` renders nearly the whole quad at the bright top-edge Fresnel value instead of Gouraud-interpolating to the dim bottom edge — a concrete confirmation of this plan's own predicted design-decision-8 gap, in the one scene actually shaped to detect it. All three patterns logged in `docs/d3d9-divergence-report.md`'s new "Cross-backend measurement (D9-A6)" section, **none investigated further or fixed**, per this row's own explicit rule. Vulkan/D3D11 remain unmeasured. |
| *(pending)* | **`D9-112` CLOSED — `SpriteBatch::Begin(effect)` wiring, Phase D9-11 FULLY CLOSED.** New `D3D9SpriteBatchBackend::SetCustomEffect()` (flush-on-change, mirrors D3D11's identical pattern). `FlushBatch()` branches on a valid custom `D3D9EffectBackend`: uploads viewport size via `D9-111`'s own generic `SetUniformVec2("vpSize", ...)` (no dedicated method needed, unlike D3D11's `SetViewportSizeEXT()`), calls `Apply()` then `Bind()`, replacing the stock shader/`MatrixTransform` block — vertex declaration/texture/sampler binding stay unchanged between paths (D3D9's declaration is a decoupled device state, simpler than D3D11's shader-baked `InputLayout`). New `D3D9GraphicsBackend::CreateEffectBackend()` + the matching `CMakeLists.txt` circular-link fix (D3D9 joins the `CNA`-back-link `OR` chain, closing the gap `D9-10` deferred here). **Real bug found and fixed**: moving `D3D9EffectBackend.cpp` out of the main glob while `D3D9ConstantTable.cpp` stayed in it created a genuine link-order cycle between the two new targets (`undefined reference to ParseConstantTableEXT` on every D3D9 test binary) — root-caused and fixed by moving `D3D9ConstantTable.cpp` into the isolated effect target too (it has no other consumer). New `D3D9_SpriteBatch_CustomEffect` CTest (4/4) through the real public `SpriteBatch`/`ShaderEffect` API, mirroring D3D11's own `DX-71` test bar in real D3D9 SM2/SM3 HLSL — all 4 passed on the first successful build. Mutation-verified (forced the custom-effect branch unreachable, confirmed exactly the color-inversion discriminator failed while position/restore-to-stock checks correctly stayed green; reverted clean). Full D3D9 suite now 17/17; EasyGL/`CnaTests` regression-checked. |
| `f69094dd` | **`D9-111` CLOSED — `D3D9EffectBackend`, real runtime `D3DCompile()` custom-ShaderEffect backend**. New `D3D9EffectBackend.{hpp,cpp}` (`IEffectBackend`): `CompileProgram()` compiles vertex+pixel source separately (`vs_2_0`/`ps_2_0` Reach, `vs_3_0`/`ps_3_0` HiDef), `SetUniform*` genuinely looks `name` up per-stage via `D9-110`'s own real register tables — not D3D11EffectBackend's own fixed-slot convention, since D3D9 registers are compiler-assigned and vary per shader. Build-isolated per design decision 16: `D3D9EffectBackend.cpp` excluded from the main backend source glob, built as its own `cna_backend_graphics_d3d9_effect` static library with `d3dcompiler` linked ONLY there — the stock D3D9 pipeline stays dependency-free, diverging from D3D11/D3D12's own simpler "link it to the whole backend" precedent. New `D3D9_EffectBackend` CTest (6/6), matching D3D11EffectBackend's own `DX-58` test bar (compile+bind+draw+uniform-driven pixel readback) on a real device — all 6 passed on the FIRST successful build. **Real finding via mutation-testing**: the original single "far-away WorldViewProj leaves background unpainted" check wasn't discriminating — a fully-disabled vertex-constant upload also leaves the register at zero, also degenerating the triangle to nothing, for a completely different reason. Fixed by splitting into a positive-case anchor (identity re-upload must still paint red) before the negative case; re-mutated and confirmed the anchor now correctly fails first. All mutations reverted (`diff`-confirmed byte-identical each time). Full D3D9 suite now 16/16; EasyGL/CNA build regression-checked. `D9-112` remains open. |
| `d01bbfb1` | **Phase D9-11 authorized 2026-07-15; `D9-110` (CTAB constant-table parser) CLOSED**. New `D3D9ConstantTable.{hpp,cpp}` — real `D3DXSHADER_CONSTANTTABLE`/`D3DXSHADER_CONSTANTINFO` binary parsing (no D3DX/`ID3DXConstantTable`, design decision 9), locating the CTAB comment token via the same DWORD-walking strategy `compare_against_fxb.py` (`D9-73`) already proved against 66 real shaders. New `D3D9_ConstantTable` CTest (14/14): compiles a known 3-constant shader via real `D3DCompile()`, cross-checks against `D3DDisassemble()`'s own independent `"// Registers:"` text (same regex as `extract_shader_registers.py`). **Found and fixed a real bug via this cross-check**: first attempt returned 0 constants — a raw byte-dump against real compiler output found every CTAB offset field is relative to 4 bytes past the `'CTAB'` FourCC (where `Size` begins), not the FourCC itself. Mutation-verified (reverted the fix, parser reads garbage and crashes with `std::bad_alloc` — an even more dramatic catch than a value mismatch); reverted clean, reconfirmed 14/14. Added a defensive bound so malformed CTAB data returns empty instead of crashing. Full D3D9 suite now 15/15; EasyGL/CNA build unaffected (file only compiles under D3D9). |
| `4ec9e781` | **`D9-123` FULLY CLOSED — the `gtest_discover_tests` cross-compile follow-up**. `CMakeLists.txt:7117`'s `gtest_discover_tests(CnaTests DISCOVERY_MODE PRE_TEST)` had no `MINGW`/`CMAKE_CROSSCOMPILING` guard and tried to directly execute the cross-compiled `CnaTests.exe` (a PE32+ binary) to enumerate test names — invisible before the setenv fix landed. Measured the naive per-test-Wine-spawn cost first (~1.2s/spawn × 4367 discovered cases ≈ 87 minutes) before picking an approach. Fixed by setting `CROSSCOMPILING_EMULATOR` on the `CnaTests` target (same CMake-native mechanism `DX-80`'s own `cna_d3d11_ctest_command` macro already uses), routing through the correct per-backend Wine wrapper with its DXVK/vkd3d-proton authenticity gate deliberately disabled inline (`env CNA_D3D9_SKIP_DXVK_GATE=1 <wrapper>`) — `CnaTests` spans non-Graphics namespaces that never open a device. Also automatically fixed `CnaInputTests`' own separate `add_test`, no extra change needed. Deliberately kept `gtest_discover_tests` as-is rather than redesigning granularity: confirmed the real workflow (`ctest -L D3D9`) label-filters and none of the 4367 discovered cases carry that label, so the 87-minute concern never applies to the actual documented command. **Verified end-to-end**: `ctest -L D3D9` 14/14 pass (no more test-file-generation crash); `ctest -N` shows 4383 total registered tests; 2 individual discovered cases plus `CnaInputTests` itself explicitly run via `ctest -R` and genuinely execute through Wine, not just register. EasyGL regression-checked (reconfigured + rebuilt, same 2 spot-checks pass natively, `CMAKE_CROSSCOMPILING` guard correctly no-ops). Not independently re-verified on D3D11/D3D12's own build dirs. `plan_dx9.md`'s `D9-123` row now ✅ in full. |
| `5e5dcc7c` | **`D9-123` setenv compile blocker IMPLEMENTED (project-owner go-ahead given) — `CnaTests` compiles under D3D9 for the first time ever**. All 62 `::setenv()`/`::unsetenv()` call sites (60 setenv + 2 unsetenv — a small correction from the proposal's "63+2" estimate) across 13 files replaced with `System::Environment::SetEnvironmentVariable`; `#include "System/Environment.hpp"` added where missing. `tools/audio/audio_no_hardware_harness.cpp` already had a working `#if _WIN32` `_putenv_s()` branch (not actually blocking) — simplified to the shared wrapper for consistency anyway. EasyGL regression-checked: 491/491 tests pass across the 11 affected suites, full-output-grepped for `FAILED`. D3D9 verified: compiles and links with zero errors and zero remaining setenv/unsetenv. Surfaced a second, distinct `gtest_discover_tests` blocker (see the entry above, fixed the same day). |
| `cf082a52` | **`D9-123` written proposal (superseded by implementation above)** — new `docs/cnatests-mingw-setenv-proposal.md`, grounded by actually grepping every call site rather than the earlier "~10 test files" estimate. Confirmed a zero-new-risk fix already exists: `sharp-runtime`'s `System::Environment::SetEnvironmentVariable` already branches `_putenv_s()` on `_WIN32`, already compiles/links in the existing D3D11/D3D12 MinGW builds, matches .NET's empty-value-unsets convention — a mechanical 1:1 replace, no new abstraction. |
| `5e3a82c0` | **`D9-130` CLOSED (Phase D9-13 docs) — new `docs/d3d9-backend.md`, a full `D3D9` column across all 7 tables in `docs/graphics-backend-feature-matrix.md`, and a `README.md`/`programs.md` build-doc update**. `docs/d3d9-backend.md` leads with XNA pixel-authenticity (not a feature checklist), the real-Microsoft-shader fact, and the 0/31-divergence oracle result, following `docs/d3d11-backend.md`'s own structure. Every feature-matrix cell was grounded by reading `tools/xna-oracle/scenes/*.scene` directly (confirmed exact `SpriteSortMode`/`AlphaFunction`/`WeightsPerVertex` coverage, and that `EnvironmentMapEffect.specularEnabled` is structurally unreachable, `D9-82e`) rather than recalled from memory; ungrounded cells marked honestly `⬜`/`🟨`. New matrix section "Remaining genuine D3D9 limitations", matching the Vulkan/Bgfx precedent sections. `README.md`: new `D3D9` Project-Status bullet, a "Build (Windows cross-compilation — D3D9 backend)" section, a Tested-Compilers row. `programs.md` §9: new D3D9-specific three-Wine-prefix subsection, closing the gap `plan_dx9.md`'s own line 103 flagged. |
| `2a0f1576` | **Phase D9-12 `D9-122` CLOSED — systematic mutation-verification of `D3D9_Smoke`/`D3D9_Common` + the 4 reused state tests**. Classified every check as CONFIRMED (explicit prior mutation evidence) or GAP, then ran 6 new mutation cycles against the highest-priority GAPs (`ApplyBlendState`'s `D3DRS_DESTBLEND`, `PerformResetRecovery`'s `deviceLost_` flag — which also surfaced that a broken recovery crashes the whole test binary via an uncaught `DeviceLostException`, not just failing one check — `SetRenderTargets`' per-slot MRT bind, `BindAsRenderTarget`, `D3D9VertexBufferBackend::Upload`, `D3D9TextureCubeBackend::SetData`), each confirmed to fail exactly the predicted check(s) and nothing else, then reverted clean. Full D3D9 CTest suite reconfirmed 14/14 independently (not just the closing agent's own self-report). Full detail in `plan_dx9.md`'s own `D9-122` row and §2's Phase D9-12 section above. |
| `65ba7ce8` | **Phase D9-12 `D9-120`/`D9-121` CLOSED — the D9-A oracle corpus is now a real, checked-in CTest, plus a written divergence report**. All 31 real-XNA-4.0 reference PNGs regenerated fresh and confirmed byte-identical to earlier cached renders before committing (`tools/xna-oracle/reference/*.png`, 132 KB). New `scripts/run-oracle-corpus-diff.sh` + `D3D9_XNA_Diff` CTest -- diffs every scene against its checked-in reference at `tolerance=0`, needs only the D3D9 Wine prefix (never the XNA one) to run. Mutation-verified (corrupted one reference pixel, confirmed exactly that scene failed with the real delta, restored). New `docs/d3d9-divergence-report.md`: headline **0/31 scenes diverge from real XNA 4.0**, with an explicit "not yet covered" table and an honest status re-read of all 6 project-wide CNA-vs-XNA divergences (3 now closed on D3D9, 4 now measured-correct on D3D9, 1/5/6 still open). Full D3D9 CTest suite now 14/14. |
| `389470fb` | **Phase D9-10 follow-up CLOSED — `TextureCube`/`Texture3D` profile size ceilings + `MaxRenderTargets` enforcement**. Reuses `D3D9ProfileCapabilities`' own already-written helpers (no new capability logic, just wiring): `TextureCube` throws past 512 (Reach)/4096 (HiDef); `Texture3D` throws UNCONDITIONALLY under Reach (volume textures unsupported entirely) and past 256 under HiDef; `GraphicsDevice::SetRenderTargets()` throws past 1 target under Reach (4 under HiDef) -- separate from `MAX_RENDERTARGET_BINDINGS` (XNA's general cap) and `D9-54`'s own hardware-cap enforcement. 8 new checks (`D3D9_GraphicsProfile` now 19/19), mutation-verified (disabled all 3 new profile functions at once, confirmed exactly the 6 tied checks failed, restored) -- also found and fixed a real bug in the CTest's OWN cleanup logic (only unbinding render targets on the throw path left them bound and crashed `Present()` when a mutation made the call NOT throw). Regression-checked again on EasyGL (150 relevant `CnaTests` cases, all green). Full D3D9 CTest suite 13/13 green. Only NPOT-wrap-on-`Reach` and hardware-instancing's HiDef-only gate remain open in Phase D9-10. |
| `9c3210df` | **Phase D9-10 CLOSED (`D9-100`–`D9-105`) — `GraphicsProfile.Reach`/`HiDef` made real on D3D9, plus a real cross-backend `GraphicsProfile`-propagation bug found and fixed**. New `D3D9ProfileCapabilities.{hpp,cpp}` (`D3DCAPS9` probed via `IDirect3D9::GetDeviceCaps`/`CheckDeviceFormat`/`CheckDeviceType`/`CheckDeviceMultiSampleType`, all pre-device-creation, backend-local under `#ifdef CNA_BACKEND_D3D9`). `IsProfileSupported()`/`QueryRenderTargetFormat()`/`QueryBackBufferFormat()` real; `Texture2D` throws `System::NotSupportedException` past its own profile's size ceiling (2048 Reach/4096 HiDef). Real bug found in SHARED code: `Game`'s `GraphicsDevice_` member is eagerly default-constructed (hardcoded Reach) before `GraphicsDeviceManager` exists, and `applyToExistingBackend()` never wrote a changed profile back onto the live device -- `graphics.GraphicsProfile = HiDef; graphics.ApplyChanges();` had NO path to the real device at all. Fixed with new `GraphicsDevice::SetGraphicsProfileEXT()`. EasyGL's own `CnaTests` (70 cases) regression-checked, all green. New `D3D9_GraphicsProfile` CTest, 10/10, mutation-verified. Full D3D9 CTest suite 13/13 green. |
| `47ca4a15` | **`D9-A5` grown to 31 scenes (`colored_linelist_quad`/`colored_linestrip_quad`) — completes ALL 4 real `PrimitiveType` values, both PIXEL-PERFECT (0/65536 differ) on the first attempt**. `LineList`: two SEPARATE horizontal segments at different Y rows, proving independent segments with nothing connecting them (confirmed on real XNA: RED/GREEN midpoints exact, the row between stays background). `LineStrip`: a 3-vertex "V" polyline, proving 2 CONNECTED segments share the middle vertex (confirmed on real XNA: 307 non-background pixels spanning the full expected extent, both leg midpoints exact RED). New `D3D9_Draw` Check E/F (now 6/6) — real bug found and fixed in the CTest's OWN color-packing, not CNA: `0x00FF00FFu` decodes (byte order R,G,B,A ascending, little-endian literal) to `R=255,G=0,B=255,A=0` — magenta at zero alpha, invisible — not green; fixed to `0xFF00FF00u`. Caught immediately via a full-frame debug scan showing the RED segment rendered exactly as predicted but no GREEN pixels anywhere. Mutation-verified after the fix (hardcoded both `primitiveCount`s to 1, confirmed exactly Check E/F went red, restored). All 31 corpus scenes re-verified pixel-perfect; full D3D9 CTest suite 12/12 green. |
| `426d8af7` | **`D9-A5` grown to 29 scenes (`colored_trianglestrip_quad`) — first scene to ever use `PrimitiveType.TriangleStrip`, PIXEL-PERFECT (0/65536 differ) on the first attempt**. Every earlier scene (and every existing `D3D9_Draw`/`D3D9_DrawEx` check) only ever used `TriangleList`, even though `GraphicsDevice::PrimitiveVerts()`/`ToD3D9Topology()` already handled all 4 `PrimitiveType` values unconditionally -- a real, previously-untested code path, not a new feature (no code changes needed). A 4-vertex colored quad in the canonical "Z" strip order (TL/TR/BL/BR), 4 distinct corner colors so a broken vertex-count<->primitiveCount conversion would show a missing quadrant or wrong Gouraud gradient. New `D3D9_Draw` Check D (now 4/4): an oversized strip quad sampled at the first triangle's own corner AND the second triangle's own corner (only covered if `primitiveCount` genuinely resolved to 2, not 1). Mutation-verified (hardcoded `primitiveCount=1`, confirmed exactly Check D went red, restored, reconfirmed green). All 29 corpus scenes re-verified pixel-perfect; full D3D9 CTest suite 12/12 green. |
| `b557c2bf` | **`D9-A5` grown to 28 scenes (`sprite_multitexture_quad`) — closes D9-90's own explicitly-named multi-texture-batching gap, PIXEL-PERFECT (0/65536 differ) on the first attempt**. 3 non-overlapping sprites, interleaved RED-texture/BLUE-texture/RED-texture (not RED-RED-BLUE, so the second red draw genuinely forces a SECOND rebind after the blue draw's own flush) -- new optional trailing `textureIndex` column on `spritedraw=` lines, reusing the scene format's existing `texture2*` keys rather than inventing new ones. Mutation-verified (disabled the texture-change flush trigger in `D3D9SpriteBatchBackend::Draw()`, confirmed the middle sprite's BLUE leaked into the third position -- `1600/65536` pixels wrong -- then restored and reconfirmed green). New `D3D9_SpriteBatch` Check I (now 10/10). All 28 corpus scenes re-verified pixel-perfect; full D3D9 CTest suite 12/12 green. |
| `df682701` | **Phase D9-9 `D9-93` CLOSED (3 of 5 `SpriteSortMode` values) — found and fixed a real D3D9 backend bug (`BuildMatrixTransformEXT`'s Z-row clipped any nonzero `layerDepth` sprite)**. 3 new `D9-A5` scenes (`sprite_sortmode_deferred_quad`/`sprite_sortmode_backtofront_quad`/`sprite_sortmode_fronttoback_quad`) using 2 overlapping `NonPremultiplied`-blended RED/GREEN sprites at different `layerDepth`s. First scene in the whole corpus to draw with `layerDepth != 0` — surfaced that `CreateOrthographicOffCenter(0,W,H,0,0, zFarPlane=1)` gives `Z'=-layerDepth`, outside D3D9's valid `[0,1]` clip-space Z range, silently clipping the second sprite away entirely regardless of sort mode (root-caused via the real XNA oracle producing correct output while CNA didn't). Fixed with `zFarPlane=-1` (identity Z-row, `Z'=layerDepth`) — only the Z row changes, D9-91's own X/Y half-pixel math is unaffected. All 3 new scenes pixel-perfect against real XNA 4.0 after the fix; 3 new checks added to `D3D9_SpriteBatch` (now 9/9), mutation-verified (reverted the fix, confirmed the sort-mode checks failed, restored, reconfirmed green). `SpriteSortMode.Immediate`/`.Texture` explicitly scoped out (not pixel-observable / needs multi-texture design, respectively) — see `plan_dx9.md` D9-93's own closure note. All 27 corpus scenes re-verified pixel-perfect; full D3D9 CTest suite 12/12 green. |
| `8de8e5b9` | **Phase D9-9 `D9-92` CLOSED — real `TextureAddressMode.Wrap`/`Mirror` for `SpriteBatch`, both oracle-verified with discriminating patterns**. `SetSamplerFilter()`/`SetSamplerAddressMode()` already plumbed through to the real `D9-63` `ApplySamplerState()` path -- the missing piece was purely test coverage, since `Begin()` with no args only exercises `LinearClamp`. New `spritesourcerect`/`spritesampler` scene keys + `Begin(sortMode, blendState, samplerState, null, null)` wiring. 2 new `D9-A5` scenes: `sprite_wrap_quad` (`PointWrap`, sourceRect double the texture width -- tiles RED/GREEN/RED/GREEN across 4 bands) and `sprite_mirror_quad` (manually-constructed Point/Mirror sampler, same geometry -- folds symmetrically to RED/GREEN/GREEN/RED instead, genuinely distinguishable from Wrap). Both patterns predicted before running either side, then confirmed pixel-for-pixel identical. 2 new checks added to `D3D9_SpriteBatch` (now 6/6). All 24 corpus scenes re-verified pixel-perfect; full D3D9 CTest suite 12/12 green. |
| `b889cab1` | **Phase D9-9 `D9-90`/`D9-91` CLOSED — real `D3D9SpriteBatchBackend`, half-pixel offset oracle- AND mutation-verified**. New `D3D9SpriteBatch.{hpp,cpp}`; reuses the existing stride-24 vertex layout and D3D11SpriteBatchBackend's own quad-geometry formula, real `SpriteEffect.fx` bytecode (already compiled/register-mapped by the general D9-71/72 sweep). `MatrixTransform` bakes SpriteBatch's own transform + a D3D9 half-pixel correction (`M41 += -0.5*M11` etc.) into one uniform. 3 new `D9-A5` scenes (`sprite_basic_quad`/`sprite_rotated_quad`/`sprite_flipped_quad`), all pixel-perfect on the first attempt. Real finding: a 1x1-texture scene and quadrant-center CTest sample points are BOTH structurally incapable of detecting the half-pixel offset (it shifts texture CONTENT sampling, not geometric edges) -- caught via mutation-testing, which showed the boundary check staying green with the offset removed while the multi-texel oracle scenes diverged by 4800/65536 pixels; fixed with a dedicated boundary-blend-color CTest check. New `D3D9_SpriteBatch` CTest, 4/4, mutation-verified. `D9-92` (sampler Wrap/Mirror) and `D9-93` (SpriteSortMode sweep) explicitly NOT closed -- honest gaps, not assumed. All 21 corpus scenes re-verified pixel-perfect; full D3D9 CTest suite 12/12 green. |
| `17a1a607` | **`D9-A5` grown to 19 scenes (`skinned_fourbone_quad`) — also PIXEL-PERFECT (0/65536 differ), first scene to exercise a REAL 4-bone skinning blend, completing all 3 real `WeightsPerVertex` values**. Extended vertex line format to an optional 16 columns (3rd/4th boneindex/boneweight pair); new `bone2translate`/`bone3translate` scene keys. Four pure-translation bones weighted 0.4/0.3/0.2/0.1 blend to an exact hand-derived `Translate(0.12,0.03,0)` -- a genuine two-axis shift proving all four weighted terms sum correctly. Confirmed at predicted shifted boundaries in both X and Y on both sides. All 19 scenes re-verified pixel-perfect; full D3D9 CTest suite 11/11 green. |
| `08aba091` | **Documented a genuine, unresolved D3D9 backend crash (render-target-as-texture sampling), reverted all attempted code rather than land it half-working**. See §4's own "New blocker found 2026-07-15" for the full reproduction record and recommended next step (Vulkan validation layers). |
| `83e2edf2` | **`D9-A5` grown to 18 scenes (`alphatest_never_quad`/`alphatest_always_quad`) — also PIXEL-PERFECT (0/65536 differ each), COMPLETE ALL 8 REAL XNA `AlphaTestEffect.AlphaFunction` VALUES IN THE CORPUS**. `Never` sets both branch targets negative (`clip(-1)` unconditionally, discards everything regardless of alpha); `Always` sets both positive (`clip(1)` unconditionally, discards nothing). Both reuse `alphatest_quad.scene`'s exact texture; `Never` renders pure clear color everywhere (even the alpha=255 texels that would normally pass `Greater`), `Always` renders every texel including the alpha=1/64 ones that would normally fail. No code changes needed. `AlphaTestEffect`'s entire compare-function surface is now independently verified: `Less`/`LessEqual`/`GreaterEqual`/`Greater`/`Never`/`Always` on `PSAlphaTestLtGt`, `Equal`/`NotEqual` on `PSAlphaTestEqNe`. All 18 scenes re-verified pixel-perfect; full D3D9 CTest suite 11/11 green. |
| `dab209af` | **`D9-A5` grown to 16 scenes (`alphatest_greaterequal_quad`/`alphatest_lessequal_quad`) — also PIXEL-PERFECT (0/65536 differ each), exercise `GreaterEqual`/`LessEqual`, sharing `PSAlphaTestLtGt` with `Greater`/`Less` but differing at the EXACT boundary value**. Confirmed against FNA's own `AlphaTestEffect.cs`: `GreaterEqual` sets `X=reference-threshold` (vs `Greater`'s `+threshold`); `LessEqual` sets `X=reference+threshold` (vs `Less`'s `-threshold`) -- a texel exactly at `ReferenceAlpha` passes under the `-Equal` variant, fails under the plain variant. Both reuse `alphatest_equal_quad.scene`'s own texture (which already has an exact-128 texel; `alphatest_quad.scene`'s texture never lands on 128). Predicted patterns confirmed exactly right, then pixel-for-pixel identical. No code changes needed. Completes all 4 alpha-value-dependent `PSAlphaTestLtGt` values. All 16 scenes re-verified pixel-perfect; full D3D9 CTest suite 11/11 green. |
| `ac7f39cd` | **`D9-A5` grown to 14 scenes (`alphatest_notequal_quad`) — also PIXEL-PERFECT (0/65536 differ), first scene to exercise `AlphaFunction=NotEqual`, completing coverage of both real pixel shader buckets' compare-function directions**. Confirmed against FNA's own `AlphaTestEffect.cs` source: `NotEqual` uses the identical `abs(a-x)<y` comparison as `Equal`, only the pass/fail branch targets swap. Reuses `alphatest_equal_quad.scene`'s exact texture/threshold, flips every texel's pass/fail. No code changes needed (`NotEqual` already supported). All 14 scenes re-verified pixel-perfect; full D3D9 CTest suite 11/11 green. |
| `5bf410fc` | **`D9-A5` grown to 13 scenes (`skinned_twobone_quad`) — also PIXEL-PERFECT (0/65536 differ), first scene to exercise a REAL, non-degenerate 2-bone skinning blend**. New `weightspervertex`/`bone1translate` scene keys; vertex line format extended to an optional 12 columns (2nd boneindex/boneweight pair), backward compatible. Real finding: `skinned_quad.scene`'s own comment claimed `WeightsPerVertex=1` but never actually set it -- real XNA defaults to 4, so that scene had actually been running the FourBones bucket, harmless only because its single weight pair leaves the rest 0. Fixed with explicit `weightspervertex=1`. New scene blends Bone0=Identity + Bone1=Translate(0.4,0,0) at 50/50, giving an exact hand-derived Translate(0.2,0,0) -- the whole quad shifts right by 0.2 NDC units, confirmed at the predicted shifted screen boundaries on both sides. All 13 scenes re-verified pixel-perfect; full D3D9 CTest suite 11/11 green. |
| `1f0738fc` | **`D9-A5` grown to 12 scenes (`envmap_fresnel_quad`) — also PIXEL-PERFECT (0/65536 differ), first scene to genuinely exercise `EnvironmentMapEffect.FresnelFactor` with a real per-vertex gradient**. New `fresnelfactor` scene key wired on both sides. Real finding: `envmap_quad.scene`'s own comment wrongly claimed the "non-fresnel bucket" -- real XNA defaults `FresnelFactor=1`, and neither side had ever set it, so that scene had actually been running the fresnel-ENABLED bucket the whole time, undetected because its coplanar-with-eye geometry makes Fresnel enabled/disabled coincide (`viewAngle=0` everywhere -> `pow(1,anything)=1`). Fixed with explicit `fresnelfactor=0`. New scene uses deliberately different per-vertex normals (top vs bottom edge) to escape the origin-centered-quad symmetry trap (any single shared normal gives an identical fresnelFactor at all 4 corners); hand-derived center prediction `≈(129.3,64.6,32.3)` matched the observed `(129,65,32)` exactly on both sides. All 12 scenes re-verified pixel-perfect; full D3D9 CTest suite 11/11 green. |
| `3263db79` | **`D9-A5` grown to 11 scenes (`alphatest_equal_quad`) — also PIXEL-PERFECT (0/65536 differ), first scene to exercise `AlphaFunction=Equal`, a STRUCTURALLY different pixel shader bucket (`PSAlphaTestEqNe`) from `Greater`/`Less`'s shared `PSAlphaTestLtGt`**. Confirmed against FNA's own `AlphaTestEffect.cs` source, including the exact tolerance (`threshold=0.5/255`). 4 texels straddle that boundary: `alpha=128` exact match PASSES, `alpha=127`/`129` (off by `1/255`) both FAIL, `alpha=1` FAILS -- pass/fail pattern predicted before running either side, then confirmed pixel-for-pixel. No code changes needed (`Equal` already supported). All 11 scenes re-verified pixel-perfect; full D3D9 CTest suite 11/11 green. |
| `7f2bbc7a` | **`D9-A5` grown to 10 scenes (`alphatest_less_quad`) — also PIXEL-PERFECT (0/65536 differ), first scene to exercise a SECOND `AlphaTestEffect.AlphaFunction` value (`Less`)**. Reuses `alphatest_quad`'s own texture/threshold, only `AlphaFunction` changes -- flips which texels pass vs. discard, proving the compare function is genuinely honored (not just that `clip()` exists). No code changes needed (`Less` already supported). Real finding: a PNG-encoder quirk, not a rendering bug -- a first draft used `alpha=0` for a passing texel; the shader OUTPUT matched byte-for-byte on both sides, but real XNA's `SaveAsPng` zeroed RGB for that exact-`alpha=0` pixel while CNA preserved it (confirmed `alpha==0`-specific, not general premultiply, since `alpha=64` matched exactly). Fixed by using `alpha=1` instead of `0`. All 10 scenes re-verified pixel-perfect; full D3D9 CTest suite 11/11 green. |
| `658b4c8c` | **`D9-A5` grown to 9 scenes (`fog_gradient_quad`) — also PIXEL-PERFECT (0/65536 differ), first scene to exercise `IEffectFog`**. Fog wiring added to all 5 effect branches on both sides. Required two false starts before a genuinely correct gradient rendered identically on both sides: (1) `z=0..1`/`FogStart=0`/`FogEnd=1` gave `fogFactor=saturate(-z)`, always clamped to 0 -- uniformly white on both sides, an exact but meaningless match; (2) flipping far vertices to `z=-1` for a "correct" negative view-space Z instead near-plane-clipped the whole quad away on both sides (`Projection` is also `Identity`, so clip-space z is the raw vertex z). Working fix: keep `z=0..1`, use `FogStart=0`/`FogEnd=-1` (negative) so `fogFactor=z` directly -- produced a genuine monotonic white-to-black gradient, confirmed pixel-for-pixel identical on both sides. All 9 scenes re-verified pixel-perfect; full D3D9 CTest suite 11/11 green. |
| `9b8a4e9a` | **`D9-A5` grown to 8 scenes (`multilight_textured_quad`) — also PIXEL-PERFECT (0/65536 differ)**. First scene to genuinely exercise `BasicEffect`'s multi-light SUMMATION formula (`D9-82b`'s own "2-light-sum" `ShaderIndex` bucket, structurally different from the "OneLight" bucket every earlier lit scene uses). Two active lights (diffuse 0.3+0.2, same direction) sum to the exact same dimming `lit_textured_quad`'s own single 0.5 light produces -- exact `(128,128,128,255)`, matching byte-for-byte, proving genuine summation not overwrite. A third light present but disabled (large nonzero diffuse) confirmed NOT to contribute. Extended `light1*`/`light2*` keys, applied uniformly to all 3 lit effects. All 8 scenes re-verified pixel-perfect. |
| `e0afe3a0` | **`D9-A5` grown to 7 scenes (`skinned_quad`) — also PIXEL-PERFECT (0/65536 differ). MILESTONE: all 5 XNA Stock Effects now represented in the corpus, all pixel-perfect.** Added `effect=SkinnedEffect` plus a fourth custom vertex shape (`PositionNormalTextureWeights`, stride 52, `VSInputNmTxWeights`, matches existing layout byte-for-byte). Single Identity bone at 100% weight (skinning is a no-op, matching `D9-82f`'s own CTest simplification) reduces expected math to `lit_textured_quad`'s own formula: exact `(128,128,128,255)` both sides. Same `LightingEnabled` explicit-interface-implementation carve-out found for `SkinnedEffect` too (confirmed against FNA source) -- same quirk as `EnvironmentMapEffect`, not a new bug. Also proactively added `[StructLayout(LayoutKind.Sequential)]` to both the new struct and (retroactively) `VertexPositionDualTexture` on the C# side -- C#'s default "auto" layout doesn't formally guarantee field order, which `DrawUserPrimitives<T>`'s raw-byte marshalling silently depends on. |
| `bf2f467c` | **`D9-A5` grown to 6 scenes (`envmap_quad`) — also PIXEL-PERFECT (0/65536 differ), 3rd non-BasicEffect Stock Effect**. Added `effect=EnvironmentMapEffect` plus `environmentmap*` keys, reusing the existing `PositionNormalTexture` shape. 1x1 base texture + 1x1 all-same-color `TextureCube` + dim light + `EnvironmentMapAmount=0.5`: real `lerp(texture*diffuseSum, environmentMap, environmentMapAmount)` produced exact `(164,114,89,255)` both sides. Real finding (not a bug): real XNA/FNA's `EnvironmentMapEffect` implements `IEffectLights.LightingEnabled` via explicit interface implementation, invisible on the concrete class (confirmed live: `emfx.LightingEnabled=...` is a genuine `CS1061`) -- lighting is always on, no game can disable it. CNA's own `setLightingEnabledProperty` already matches the exact same behavior (getter always true, setter throws given false); only the C++ vs C# visibility differs. Neither side calls it for this effect now. |
| `88dee0c2` | **`D9-A5` grown to 5 scenes (`dualtexture_quad`) — also PIXEL-PERFECT (0/65536 differ), 2nd non-BasicEffect Stock Effect, first scene needing a vertex shape neither side had a built-in type for**. Added `effect=DualTextureEffect` plus `texture2*`/`diffusecolor` keys and a new `vertexformat=PositionDualTexture` (stride 28, `VSInputTx2`) -- real XNA has no dual-UV vertex struct either, so both sides define their own custom `IVertexType`/`VertexDeclaration`. Two 1x1 solid-color textures + `DiffuseColor=(0.5,0.5,0.5)`: the doubling-blend formula's `*2*0.5` cancels out, expected result `(100,60,20,255)` hand-derived before running either side (matching `D9-82d`'s own proven check value), then confirmed pixel-for-pixel. Added as a third `std::unique_ptr` alongside `alphaFx`/`basicFx`, correctly avoiding a repeat of `alphatest_quad`'s own dangling-pointer bug -- no new bug this time. |
| `b0272385` | **`D9-A5` grown to 4 scenes (`alphatest_quad`) — also PIXEL-PERFECT (0/65536 differ), first non-BasicEffect Stock Effect in the corpus**. Added `effect=BasicEffect`/`AlphaTestEffect` plus `alphafunction`/`referencealpha` keys. A 2x2 texture straddling `ReferenceAlpha=128` exercises `clip()`'s real discard end to end. Real bug found and fixed live in `CnaOracleRender.cpp`: a dangling-pointer bug (not a backend bug) -- the newly-constructed Effect object was scoped inside an `if`/`else` block and destroyed before the shared `DrawUserPrimitives()` call read `GraphicsDevice::currentEffect_` (a raw pointer `Effect::Apply()` sets), causing `textured_quad`/`lit_textured_quad` to spuriously fail with garbage flags; `colored3d` passed only by allocation-timing luck. Fixed via `std::unique_ptr` at `Draw()`'s own top level; re-verified all 4 scenes pixel-perfect afterward. |
| `b4252bfa` | **`D9-A5` grown to 3 scenes (`lit_textured_quad`) — also PIXEL-PERFECT (0/65536 differ)**. Extended the shared scene format to a third vertex shape (`vertexformat=PositionNormalTexture`, `VSInputNmTx`'s stride-32 shape) plus `ambientcolor`/`light0enabled`/`light0diffuse`/`light0direction` keys wired to `BasicEffect.AmbientLightColor`/`DirectionalLight0` on both sides. Deliberately dimmed the light (`diffuse=0.5`, no ambient) rather than a bright one that would saturate to full intensity and prove nothing about whether lighting math is genuinely applied -- the dimmed version visibly halves the texture color and still matches real XNA exactly. First evidence this backend's lit+textured `BasicEffect` dispatch is genuinely indistinguishable from real XNA 4.0, not just hand-verified pixel math. |
| `fd8df277` | **`D9-A5` grown to 2 scenes (`textured_quad`) — also PIXEL-PERFECT (0/65536 differ)**. Extended the shared scene format to a second vertex shape (`vertexformat=PositionColor`/`PositionTexture`) and inline procedural texture data (`texturewidth`/`textureheight`/`texturefilter`/`texturepixel`, no content-pipeline asset needed) on both `Oracle.cs` and `CnaOracleRender.cpp`. Exact match confirmed including the UV=(0.5,0.5) point-filter texel-boundary pixel. Real bug found and fixed in `Oracle.cs` itself: `ParseBool` used a C# 6 expression-bodied member the real .NET-4.0-era `csc.exe` rejects outright (`CS1002`/`CS1519`) -- meaning `D9-A3`'s own original "pixel-perfect" claim had never actually been verified against the rewritten, scene-driven `Oracle.cs` (only the old hardcoded spike); fixed, recompiled, re-ran `colored3d` and reconfirmed 0/65536. |
| `848e56b2` | **`D9-A3`/`D9-A4` closed (XNA oracle diff harness) — first real oracle comparison is PIXEL-PERFECT (0/65536 differ)**. New shared `.scene` text format (`tools/xna-oracle/scenes/*.scene`), a rewritten scene-driven `tools/xna-oracle/Oracle.cs` (moved from `dx9-spike/`), a new `tools/xna-oracle/CnaOracleRender.cpp` (real public `Game`/`GraphicsDeviceManager`/`BasicEffect` API, `cna_oracle_render` CMake target), and `scripts/xna-diff.py` (needs Pillow, `--tolerance` defaults to 0, mutation-verified). Installed DXVK into the XNA oracle's own Wine prefix (`~/.wine-cna-xna40`) -- `D9-A4`'s own critical prerequisite -- confirmed via the adapter string flipping from WineD3D's spoofed string to the real GPU. `colored3d` scene (`D9-A2`'s own original triangle) matches real XNA 4.0 byte-for-byte across all 65536 pixels. `D9-A5`'s corpus now has its first scene, growing incrementally from here. |
| `6fd21fa3` | **`D9-64` closed (reuse backend-agnostic state CTests) — Phase D9-6 now FULLY CLOSED (all 5 rows)**. Reused D3D11's own 4-test subset (`easygl_blendstate_opaque_test.cpp`/`easygl_blendstate_alphablend_test.cpp`/`easygl_depthstencilstate_stencil_enable_test.cpp`/`easygl_rasterizerstate_cullmode_test.cpp`, verbatim) as new `D3D9_BlendState_Opaque`/`D3D9_BlendState_AlphaBlend`/`D3D9_DepthStencilState_StencilEnable`/`D3D9_RasterizerState_CullMode` CTests. Found and fixed 2 real, pre-existing backend bugs: (1) `SetDepthTestEnabled`/`SetDepthWriteEnabled` were silent-throw stubs since `D9-11`, never wired up -- same class of bug as D3D11's own 2026-07-14 fix (`191c28f1`), now direct `SetRenderState(D3DRS_ZENABLE/ZWRITEENABLE)` calls (`SetBlendEnabled` -> deliberate no-op, matching D3D11/D3D12); (2) `UpdatePresentationFormatEXT()` deferred a changed `DepthStencilFormat` until the next `Present()`, causing `Clear()` to fail `D3DERR_INVALIDCALL` on any test drawing depth/stencil content on the literal first frame -- fixed by applying eagerly inside `UpdatePresentationFormatEXT()` itself (within the interface's own documented allowance, no `IGraphicsBackend.hpp` change). New `D3D9_Smoke` Check Z (2 checks, ported from D3D11's own near/far depth-test proof) confirms fix 1 for real. Both mutation-verified. Full D3D9 CTest suite: 11/11 binaries green (`D3D9_Smoke` now 55/55). |
| `90f59e7c` | **`D9-83` closed (`DrawInstancedPrimitivesEx` via `SetStreamSourceFreq`) — Phase D9-8's dispatch+instancing work is now COMPLETE**, only `D9-84` remains. New `D3D9InstancedDraw.cpp`, a fresh NOXNA `vs_2_0`/`ps_2_0` shader (`shaders/cna/Instanced3D.hlsl`, real XNA has no per-instance-aware Stock Effect shader) compiled+disassembly-verified, new stride-64 2-stream vertex declaration. `SetStreamSourceFreq(0/1, INDEXEDDATA\|count / INSTANCEDATA\|1)` per MSDN, reset to 1 before returning. Real bug found and fixed during development was in the new CTest's own pixel-sample coordinates (sat exactly on the test triangle's diagonal hypotenuse), not the instancing logic -- every D3D9 API call returned `S_OK` throughout. New `D3D9_Instanced` CTest, 4/4 (two distinct instances in one draw call, null-instanceVb fallback, stream-frequency reset regression check). Mutation-verified (hardcoded the instance-count frequency to 1; exactly the 2nd-instance check went red). Full 7-CTest D3D9 suite passes. |
| `d945ec59` | **`D9-82f` closed (`SkinnedEffect` dispatch) — Phase D9-8's dispatch work is now COMPLETE for all 5 XNA Stock Effects**. This row's own "12 unblocked" estimate was exactly right, same as `D9-82e`'s. New `DrawSkinnedEffectEXT()` + `UploadBonesVS()`. `VSInputNmTxWeights` matches the existing stride-52 layout byte-for-byte. `preferPerPixelLighting` always `false` makes the pixel-lighting `ShaderIndex` bucket structurally unreachable. `Bones[72]` (216 registers, 3/bone) reuses the exact same "first 3 columns of the transposed matrix" packing `UploadMatrixConstantVS` already established for `World`/`WorldInverseTranspose`. `D3D9_DrawEx` extended to 17/17 (2 new real checks, Identity-bone skinning-as-no-op design so the expected math reuses the established lit-textured formulas while still exercising the full `Bones[72]` upload path). Mutation-verified (commented out the entire `UploadBonesVS()` call; both new checks went red -- a zero skinning matrix degenerates the triangle to a point -- everything else stayed green). Full 6-CTest D3D9 suite passes. |
| `da8504c6` | **`D9-82e` closed (`EnvironmentMapEffect` dispatch)** — this row's own "8 unblocked" estimate was exactly right this time. New `DrawEnvironmentMapEffectEXT()`; `specularEnabled` always `false` makes the 8 specular `ShaderIndex` values structurally unreachable (no separate throw branch needed). `VSInputNmTx` matches the existing stride-32 layout exactly -- no new vertex declaration needed (unlike `D9-82d`). Factored `oneLight` derivation out of `DrawBasicEffectEXT()` into a shared `ComputeOneLightEXT()`. `EmissiveColor` needs no reconstruction here (`FillGpuDrawParams()` already pre-folds it). `D3D9_DrawEx` extended to 15/15 (2 new real checks mirroring `BasicEffect`'s own Check C/D bucket-selection discipline, non-fresnel only for exactness). Mutation-verified (forced the shared `ComputeOneLightEXT()` to always `true`; BOTH `BasicEffect`'s AND `EnvironmentMapEffect`'s own 2-light checks went red simultaneously, confirming the shared helper is genuinely shared). Full 6-CTest D3D9 suite passes. |
| `d7fd2187` | **`D9-82d` closed (`DualTextureEffect` dispatch)** — this row's own original "4 ShaderIndex values, all unblocked" claim was wrong: only 2 of 4 are actually drawable. new `DrawDualTextureEffectEXT()`. Real finding: `VSInputTx2` needs a genuine 2-UV-set vertex (28 bytes) with no equivalent among the 5 shared layouts (D3D11's own reimplementation sidesteps this with a single shared UV set, not an option here since this backend must draw the real unmodified compiled shader) — resolved with a new, D3D9-only stride-28 vertex declaration (safe, backend-local, doesn't touch `GpuDrawParams`/other backends). `D3D9_Common` now 29/29. `D3D9_DrawEx` extended to 13/13 (1 new real check: the doubling-blend formula, exact `(100,60,20,255)`). Mutation-verified (skipped `DiffuseColor` upload, confirmed only the new check went red). Full 6-CTest D3D9 suite passes. |
| `55e1cd61` | **`D9-82c` closed (`AlphaTestEffect` dispatch)**: new `DrawAlphaTestEffectEXT()`, all 8 `ShaderIndex` values real, no vertex-layout gap this time (`AlphaTestEffect`'s two `VSInput` shapes map 1:1 onto the existing strides). `GpuDrawParams::alphaTest` uploads verbatim -- already exactly the real register layout, no reconstruction needed (unlike `BasicEffect`'s `EmissiveColor`). Factored `ComputeFogVectorEXT()` out into a helper shared with `D9-82b`. `D3D9_DrawEx` extended to 12/12 (3 new real checks: `Less` passes, `Less` fails/discarded, `Equal` passes on the vertex-color bucket). Mutation-verified (forced `isEqNe=false`, confirmed only the `Equal`-bucket check went red). Full 6-CTest D3D9 suite passes. |
| `5e502529` | **`D9-82b` closed (`DrawPrimitivesEx` entry point + `BasicEffect` dispatch)**: new `D3D9EffectDraw.cpp`; new "soft" `TryUpload*ShaderConstantEXT` helpers. Real, honest finding: only 10 of `BasicEffect`'s 32 `ShaderIndex` values are actually drawable (no CNA vertex layout for the rest) — narrower than this row's original 24-value estimate, documented not hidden. Corrected `D9-81`'s `oneLight` finding (the original "read `SkinnedEffect.cpp` directly" text wasn't actually reachable from `GpuDrawParams`-only input; the real fix is a provably-lossless derivation from existing `GpuDrawParams` fields). New `D3D9_DrawEx` CTest, 10/10, every expected pixel hand-computed from `BasicEffect.fx`/`Lighting.fxh`'s own formulas. Mutation-verified (forced `oneLight=true`, confirmed only the bucket-sensitive check went red). Full 6-CTest D3D9 suite passes. |
| `031e33a5` | **`D9-82` closed (first real 3D triangle) — split from its original scope into `D9-82`/`D9-82b`**: new `D3D9ConstantUpload` (name-keyed register lookup + `Set{Vertex,Pixel}ShaderConstantF`); real `DrawColoredPrimitives`/`DrawIndexedColoredPrimitives` (stride-16, `BasicEffect` `ShaderIndex 3` only, chaining `D9-80`'s dispatch into `D9-74`'s shader cache); new stride-keyed vertex-declaration cache. Found and fixed a second real trap live (not the predicted `D3DCULL` one): `D9-22`'s `D3DDECLTYPE_D3DCOLOR` for `COLOR0` silently swapped R/B against XNA's own R,G,B,A `Color.PackedValue` layout (confirmed: fed red, read back blue, before the fix) — switched to `D3DDECLTYPE_UBYTE4N` (no reorder), confirmed exact red after. `D3D9_Common`'s stride-16/24 assertions updated to match. New `D3D9_Draw` CTest, 3/3 (paint non-indexed, paint indexed, real `WorldViewProj`-upload proof). Mutation-verified (corrupted `DiffuseColor`, confirmed only the mutated check went red). Full 5-CTest D3D9 suite passes. |
| `e5aa797b` | **`D9-80`/`D9-81` closed (XNA shader dispatch + audit)**: new `D3D9ShaderDispatch` — `Compute<Effect>ShaderIndex()`/`Get<Effect>{Vertex,Pixel}ShaderNameEXT()` for all 5 stock effects, transcribed from FNA's `.cs` sources + the vendored `.fx` files' own tables. `D9-81`'s audit independently re-verified against current source (forked agent): all 4 `GpuDrawParams` gaps still real, but `oneLight`/`isEqNe` turn out resolvable from CNA's own existing internal state with no `GpuDrawParams` change (only `PreferPerPixelLighting`/`specularEnabled` remain genuine cross-cutting blockers). New `D3D9_ShaderDispatch` CTest, 23 checks. Mutation-testing found a real gap in the test's own first draft (a prefix-only sweep missed a corrupted table entry); rewrote as an exact-match sweep against an independently-typed expected array, re-confirmed the mutation is now caught. Full 4-CTest D3D9 suite passes. |
| `678bc3be` | **`D9-74` closed (`D3D9ShaderCache`) — Phase D9-7 FULLY CLOSED** (`D9-73` honestly 🟨): installed DXVK into `~/.wine-cna-d3d9-spike` (now has both the real compiler and a live device); new `D3D9ShaderCache` + `Shaders::kAllShaders[]` manifest (regenerated, not hand-typed) + new `D3D9_ShaderCache` CTest (4 checks: all 66 create live, caching works, unknown names throw, stage-aware lookup). Mutation-verified (skipped one shader in `CreateAllEXT()`, confirmed the count-dependent checks went red). Full 3-CTest D3D9 suite passes. |
| `7ecd2d42` | **`D9-72` closed (transcribe register layout)**: real, empirical finding (`EnvironmentMapEffect.fx`'s `VSEnvMap` allocates `World` only 3 registers, not the naively-assumed 4, since that entry point never reads `pos_ws.w`) invalidated the plan's own original hand-derive-from-source approach. New `extract_shader_registers.py` compiles+disassembles all 66 shaders via a new `disasm_tool.cpp`, parsing the compiler's own `// Registers:` comment block for the real, per-entry-point ground truth. Output `D3D9ShaderRegisters.hpp` (627 lines), compiles clean, spot-checked against 3 independently-verified cases. |
| `dddeecbc` | **`D9-71` closed (compile all 66 entry points)**: new `compile_shaders_sm2.py` parses the entry-point list from the vendored `.fx` files' own `compile` statements (not hand-maintained), cross-builds the moved-in `fxc_tool.cpp` with MinGW-w64, compiles via a bare `wine` call against `~/.wine-cna-d3d9-spike`. Real run: 66/66 compiled, 0 failures, into a checked-in `d3d9_shaders.hpp` (381 KB) confirmed to compile clean as real C++ and to regenerate byte-identically on a second run. Bonus: re-ran `compare_against_fxb.py` against the real header's own bytecode — 61/66 exact matches, same 5 divergent `PixelLighting` variants the Phase D9-0 spike already found. `fxc_tool.cpp`/`compare_against_fxb.py` fully moved out of `dx9-spike/` into their real home. |
| `64de9d29` | **`D9-70` closed (vendor Stock Effects HLSL)**: all 10 files copied byte-for-byte from the FNA tree into `src/CNA/Internal/Backends/D3D9/shaders/xna/`, plus `LICENSE`, a provenance `README.md` (66 entry points, grep-verified), and a specific `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md` entry. New `scripts/verify-d3d9-stock-effects-vendored.sh` mechanically diffs against the FNA tree. Mutation-verified (appended a line to the vendored `BasicEffect.fx`, confirmed the script reports `MISMATCH`/exit 1). First row of Phase D9-7. |
| `eb373571` | **`D9-63` closed (`ApplySamplerState`) — Phase D9-6 down to just `D9-64`**: plain `SetSamplerState()` calls (design decision 11), using the `D9-21` mapping tables; slot bound-checked against real `D3DCAPS9::MaxSimultaneousTextures`, not a hardcoded 16. `D3DSAMP_SRGBTEXTURE` genuinely out of scope (interface signature carries no sRGB parameter, same category as `D9-60`'s own `D3DRS_COLORWRITEENABLE` gap). New `D3D9_Smoke` Check Y (2 checks): values read back via `GetSamplerState()` (no draw needed) confirm an exact match; out-of-range slot silently no-ops. Mutation-verified (hardcoded `D3DSAMP_ADDRESSU` to ignore the requested value, confirmed exactly that assertion went red). `D3D9_Smoke` now 53/53. |
| `1206fc42` | **`D9-56` closed (NPOT capability) — Phase D9-5 FULLY CLOSED (all 7 rows)**: new NOXNA `RequiresPowerOfTwoTexturesEXT()`/`NonPowerOfTwoRequiresClampAddressingEXT()` surface the real `D3DCAPS9::TextureCaps` `POW2`/`NONPOW2CONDITIONAL` bits. This dev environment's DXVK device reports full, unconditional NPOT support, matching `D9-3`'s own original caps dump. New `D3D9_Smoke` Check X (2 checks): asserts the exact reported capability, then round-trips a genuinely non-power-of-two (5×3) texture for real. Enforcing the `Reach`-profile "no Wrap on NPOT" restriction itself is deferred to `D9-10`/`D9-82` (no draw/sampler path exists yet). Mutation-verified (hardcoded the POW2 helper to always return true, confirmed exactly that assertion went red). `D3D9_Smoke` now 51/51. |
| `f33d4fe9` | **`D9-55` closed (occlusion queries)**: new `D3D9OcclusionQueryBackend` (`IDirect3DQuery9`, `D3DQUERYTYPE_OCCLUSION`), gated on the official D3D9 support-probe idiom (`CreateQuery(type, nullptr)`). New `D3D9_Smoke` Check W (3 checks). Mutation-verified (forced `IsComplete()` to always return false, confirmed exactly that assertion went red). `D3D9_Smoke` now 49/49. `D9-56` (NPOT) is the only Phase D9-5 row left open. |
| `9c8ccfe9` | **`D9-54` closed (MRT)**: real `D3D9GraphicsBackend::SetRenderTargets(rts, count)` (`SetRenderTarget(i, surface)` per slot, unused slots disabled, over-request throws per design decision 13, deliberately not matching D3D11/D3D12's own silent-clamp precedent). Real, unplanned finding: an MRT bind isn't representable by the single-pointer `currentCustomRT_`/`currentCustomCubeRT_` tracking, so unbinding via `SetRenderTargets(nullptr, 0)` silently failed to restore the back buffer — fixed by making `RestoreBackBufferRenderTargetEXT()` unconditional in `SetRenderTarget2D()`'s/`SetRenderTargetCubeFace()`'s own `!rt` branches. New `D3D9_Smoke` Check V (3 checks). Mutation-verified (disabled the over-request guard, exactly that assertion went red). `D3D9_Smoke` now 46/46. `D9-55`–`56` (occlusion/NPOT) remain open. |
| `9b309cc5` | **`D9-53` closed**: new `D3D9RenderTargetBackend`/`D3D9RenderTargetCubeBackend` (`D3DUSAGE_RENDERTARGET`, `D3DPOOL_DEFAULT`, registered with the `D9-40` device-lost registry; real MSAA via `CheckDeviceMultiSampleType`, resolved via `StretchRect` on unbind). Three real, unplanned findings fixed: `EnsureDeviceSize()`'s resize path never released `D3DPOOL_DEFAULT` resources before `Reset()` (only the device-lost path did); a cached depth-stencil-surface `ComPtr` is itself an app-held reference to a losable resource and must be released before every `Reset()` too (DXVK's own "still has alive losable resources" diagnostic caught this immediately); `IGraphicsBackend::SetRenderTargetCubeFace()`'s inherited default never actually unbinds a cube target for real, fixed with an explicit override + a second `currentCustomCubeRT_` field. New `D3D9_Smoke` Checks S/T/U (6 checks): 2D/cube/MSAA render targets, each create/bind/Clear/readback (via `GetRenderTargetData()`)/unbind-restores-back-buffer. Mutation-verified (dropped the MSAA resolve `StretchRect` call, exactly Check U's assertion went red). `D3D9_Smoke` now 43/43. `D9-54`–`56` (MRT/occlusion/NPOT) remain open. |
| `bfadcb0e` | **Phase D9-5 partially closed** (`D9-50`/`D9-51`/`D9-52`): new `D3D9TextureBackend`/`D3D9TextureCubeBackend`/`D3D9Texture3DBackend` (`D3DFMT_A8B8G8R8`, `D3DPOOL_MANAGED`). Found empirically that `D9-52`'s own premise only half-applies: `ITextureBackend` (2D) has no `GetData()` at all — `Texture2D::GetData()` is CPU-shadow-based, same architecture as D3D11 — while `ITextureCubeBackend`/`ITexture3DBackend` genuinely delegate `GetData()` to the backend, and those ARE real `LockRect`/`LockBox` reads, exactly as `D9-4`'s spike predicted (no staging/`SYSTEMMEM` fallback needed). Volume/cube-map creation gated on real `D3DCAPS9` (`MaxVolumeExtent`/`D3DPTEXTURECAPS_CUBEMAP`), not assumed. New `D3D9_Smoke` Checks Q/R (6 checks): exact-byte round-trips via direct locks on the `D3DPOOL_MANAGED` resources (no staging texture needed). Mutation-verified: corrupting the 2D upload's source-row offset turned exactly Check Q's first assertion red, nothing else; reverted, reconfirmed 36/36 green. `D9-53`–`56` (render targets/MRT/occlusion/NPOT) remain open. |
| `3e855b2d` | **Phase D9-4 fully closed** (`D9-40`/`D9-41`/`D9-42`): real `D3D9VertexBufferBackend`/`D3D9IndexBufferBackend` (16-bit and 32-bit, `CreateIndexBuffer32()` explicitly overridden), `Lock`/`Unlock` with `SetDataOptions` → `D3DLOCK_DISCARD`/`NOOVERWRITE`. Real finding: `D3DUSAGE_DYNAMIC` requires `D3DPOOL_DEFAULT` (forbidden with `POOL_MANAGED`), so these buffers do NOT survive `Reset()` automatically — new `ID3D9DefaultPoolResourceEXT` registry lets `D9-34`'s recovery path release them before `Reset()`, each recreating lazily on next use (real XNA/D3D9 behavior). Mutation-verified (`CreateIndexBuffer32()` temporarily broken to build a 16-bit buffer, caught immediately via a real uncaught exception, reverted). Also avoided the "pointer-inequality isn't sound recreation proof" false-negative this project's own D3D12 work already found once. `D3D9_Smoke` now 30/30. |
| `cbd75a0b` | **Phase D9-3 fully closed — `D9-34` (device-lost lifecycle)**: `Present()` detects real `D3DERR_DEVICELOST`, fires `DeviceLost`; while lost, polls `TestCooperativeLevel()` until `D3DERR_DEVICENOTRESET`, then fires `DeviceResetting`, calls a real `Reset()`, restores the viewport, fires `DeviceReset`. `Clear`/all `Clear*` combos/`ReadBackbuffer` now throw the real XNA `DeviceLostException` while lost. Exercised deterministically (DXVK rarely loses the device naturally) via the pre-existing `DebugSimulateContextLoss()`/`DebugRestoreContext()` test channel — new `D3D9_Smoke` Check M (8 checks): real event counts/order, a real `Reset()` during recovery, and the device genuinely working again afterward. Also fixed a separate pre-existing gap: `GraphicsDevice::getGraphicsDeviceStatusProperty()` was hardcoded to `Normal` always; now tracks the real backend-reported state. `D3D9_Smoke` now 24/24. Verified no regression on EasyGL/CnaTests. |
| `70e81079` | **`D9-32` closed (shader-model floor) + `D9-33`'s dedicated resize test (Check L)**: `GraphicsProfile::HiDef` now checked against the real `D3DCAPS9` at construction, throwing the real XNA `NoSuitableGraphicsDeviceException` if below `vs_3_0`/`ps_3_0` (only the positive path provable on this real, already-SM3-capable GPU); a new `D3D9_Smoke` Check L resizes 64×64→96×80 via the real `GraphicsDeviceManager` path and confirms the viewport, a post-resize pixel readback at both the origin and the new far edge, and `PresentationParameters` all reflect the new size. `D3D9_Smoke` now 17/17. |
| `50954798` | **`D9-30`/`D9-31` closed + `D9-33`'s resize mechanism + Phase D9-6's `D9-60`/`D9-61`/`D9-62` forced in early**: real `Direct3DCreate9`/`CreateDevice` using the game's actual requested back-buffer/depth-stencil format (the approved `GraphicsBackendCreateArgs` extension, finally consumed for real); all 6 `Clear*` combos + `Present` + `ReadBackbuffer` pixel-verified (`D3D9_Smoke` 12/12); a real `EnsureDeviceSize()` resize-via-`Reset()` mechanism (proven working, not theoretical — it's what makes the smoke test converge to the requested 64×64 size at all). Two real, unplanned findings fixed in place: DXVK genuinely rejects `SurfaceFormat::Color`'s own `D3DFMT_A8B8G8R8` as a *swap-chain* format (a real D3D9 display-format restriction, fixed with a back-buffer-specific substitution to `A8R8G8B8`); and `GraphicsDevice::Reset()` never forwarded updated presentation settings to an already-constructed backend, fixed with one more small additive `IGraphicsBackend` method (`UpdatePresentationFormatEXT`, same category as the already-approved extension). Separately, `GraphicsDevice`'s own constructor turned out to unconditionally push `BlendState`/`DepthStencilState`/`RasterizerState`/viewport defaults, forcing `D9-60`/`D9-61`/`D9-62` in immediately (real `D3DRS_*` `SetRenderState()` sequences) — no device could otherwise finish constructing. Also found 4 more silently-empty `IGraphicsBackend` virtuals `D9-11`'s own grep missed (multi-line `{}` defaults). Verified no regression on EasyGL (34 gtest+CTest checks, including 5 resize/reset-specific ones). |
| `bf26d7d1` | **Phase D9-2 fully closed** (`D9-20`–`D9-23`): new `D3D9FormatMapping`/`D3D9StateMapping`/`D3D9VertexDeclarations` + a 28-check `D3D9_Common` CTest, mutation-verified. Two non-obvious, easy-to-get-backwards findings, both verified against Microsoft's own published D3D9→DXGI legacy-format table rather than assumed: `SurfaceFormat::Color` → `D3DFMT_A8B8G8R8` (not the superficially-obvious `A8R8G8B8`), and `Rgba1010102` → `D3DFMT_A2B10G10R10` (not `A2R10G10B10`, which has no real DXGI equivalent at all). `TextureFilter` needed a new `{min,mag,mip}` triple struct, not a single enum, since D3D9 has no composed filter value. One row (`D9-21`) is 🟨: the mapping table is done, but its own "pixel-test `D3DCULL` against the oracle" obligation is honestly deferred to `D9-84` (no draw path exists yet to test it with). |
| `1a3ca71f` | **Phase D9-1 fully closed** (`D9-10`/`D9-11`/`D9-12`): D3D9 wired into `CMakeLists.txt` (6 of 7 `"D3D12"` sites, correcting a stale plan claim about the 7th — see `plan_dx9.md`'s `D9-10` row); new `D3D9GraphicsBackend` skeleton + shared `NotYetImplemented.hpp`; `GraphicsDevice.cpp` audited, zero changes needed. `CNA_GRAPHICS_BACKEND=D3D9` configures and builds clean; a runtime check confirms the skeleton's real bookkeeping methods work and its throwing methods actually throw. |
| `09121309` | **Phase D9-0 fully closed** (`D9-2`–`D9-5`): confirmed `d3d9`-alone link set (no `dxguid`); a real Wine+DXVK D3D9 device/swap-chain/`Clear`/`Present`/`GetRenderTargetData`/`LockRect` round-trip with an exact pixel match plus a full `D3DCAPS9` dump (`vs_3_0`/`ps_3_0`, `NumSimultaneousRTs=4`, 16384 max texture size, DXVK reports unconditional NPOT support — flagged as provisional/synthetic, not an authentic XNA-era driver's caps); confirmed `D3DPOOL_MANAGED` textures are genuinely `LockRect`-readable and survive `Reset()` with no re-upload (so `Texture2D::GetData()` can be a plain `LockRect` later, `D9-52`); and a new `scripts/run-wine-dxvk9.sh` (mirrors `run-wine-dxvk.sh`'s DXVK-marker gate under new `CNA_D3D9_*` env-var names), proven both ways — passes against the real `~/.wine-cna-d3d11` DXVK prefix, and correctly fails (exit 3) against a freshly-initialized, DXVK-less prefix that silently fell back to WineD3D. |
| `59a35d4c` | Recorded the project owner's two 2026-07-14 decisions in `plan_dx9.md`: implementation authorized through Phase D9-13, and the `IGraphicsBackend` boundary problem resolved via an approved additive extension. |
| `d1ae928f` | Added `plan_dx9.md` and the proven Phase D9-0 spike artifacts (`dx9-spike/`: shader compiler, `.fxb` bytecode oracle, real XNA 4.0 reference renderer) to the `feature/dx9` worktree. |
| many, see `plan_graphics.md` (2026-07-16) | **`plan_graphics.md` Phase 78 (HLSL→GLSL sample shader conversion, DEFERRED.md #11) fully closed — unrelated to the D3D work below, see this file's own top banner.** Task 945 decided (manual line-by-line porting). Task 947 went 0→**13/13**: `NetRumble` (`Clouds.fx` + the bloom trio), `PerPixelLighting`/`VertexLighting` (5 effect/technique combinations), `DistortionSample` (`Distort.fx` + `Distorters.fx`, 5 techniques), `NonPhotoRealistic` (`CartoonEffect.Fx` + `PostprocessEffect.Fx`, 8 techniques), `ShadowMapping`, `NormalMapping`, `BillboardSample`, `ShatterEffect`, `Particles3D`/`XmlParticles`, `ShipGame` (4 distinct shaders: `AnimSprite.fx`/`Blur.fx`/`NormalMapping.fx`/`Particle.fx`, incl. real GPU point sprites), `InstancedModel` (`InstancedModel.fx`, incl. real GPU hardware instancing). 4 new EasyGL-only backend capabilities landed along the way as their own tasks: **1079** (`ShaderEffect` into the 3D draw path), **1080** (custom vertex layouts for that path), **1081** (`TextureCube` sampling for custom shaders), **1082** (real GPU hardware instancing via `glVertexAttribDivisor`). `ctest -R "EasyGL_"` grew from ~190 to **231/233** across the whole campaign, same 2 pre-existing unrelated failures throughout, every task individually mutation-tested and committed separately. Full chronological detail (exact expected pixel values, discriminating-power mutation testing per shader) is in `plan_graphics.md`'s own Task 947/1079–1082 rows, not duplicated here. `plan_samples.md` updated per-sample (13 rows now say "No longer CNA-blocked"). **Not done**: the actual sample ports themselves in `../cna-samples` — out of `cna_graphics` scope. |

## 4. Current blocker / main problem

**No blocker.** Phases D9-0/D9-1/D9-2/D9-3/D9-4/D9-5/D9-6/D9-7 are all fully closed (D9-32/D9-34/
D9-60/D9-62/D9-73 honestly 🟨 — see their own plan rows for exactly what's deferred and why). Phase
D9-6's last open row, `D9-64` (reused backend-agnostic state CTests), closed 2026-07-15 and
surfaced two real, pre-existing D3D9 bugs along the way (`SetDepthTestEnabled`/
`SetDepthWriteEnabled` silent-throw stubs; `UpdatePresentationFormatEXT()`'s deferred-format-apply
timing) — both fixed and mutation-verified, see Phase D9-6's own section above.

**Phase D9-A: `D9-A3`/`D9-A4` closed 2026-07-15 — the XNA oracle diff harness is real and all
results landed so far are pixel-perfect** (`colored3d`, `textured_quad`, `lit_textured_quad`,
`alphatest_quad`, `alphatest_less_quad`, `alphatest_equal_quad`, `alphatest_notequal_quad`,
`alphatest_greaterequal_quad`, `alphatest_lessequal_quad`, `alphatest_never_quad`,
`alphatest_always_quad`, `dualtexture_quad`, `envmap_quad`, `envmap_fresnel_quad`, `skinned_quad`,
`skinned_twobone_quad`, `skinned_fourbone_quad`, `multilight_textured_quad`, `fog_gradient_quad`,
`sprite_basic_quad`, `sprite_rotated_quad`, `sprite_flipped_quad`, `sprite_wrap_quad`,
`sprite_mirror_quad`, `sprite_sortmode_deferred_quad`, `sprite_sortmode_backtofront_quad`,
`sprite_sortmode_fronttoback_quad`, `sprite_multitexture_quad`, `colored_trianglestrip_quad`,
`colored_linelist_quad`, `colored_linestrip_quad` — `0/65536` pixels differ from real XNA 4.0
each, see Phase D9-A's own section above). `D9-A5` (the scene corpus) has 31 entries and now
represents **all 5 XNA Stock Effects** (`BasicEffect`, `AlphaTestEffect`, `DualTextureEffect`,
`EnvironmentMapEffect`, `SkinnedEffect`) including `BasicEffect`'s own multi-light summation
bucket, `IEffectFog` (shared by all 5 effects), **ALL 8** `AlphaTestEffect.AlphaFunction` values
covering both real pixel shader buckets (`Less`/`LessEqual`/`GreaterEqual`/`Greater`/`Never`/
`Always` on `PSAlphaTestLtGt`, `Equal`/`NotEqual` on `PSAlphaTestEqNe` — `AlphaTestEffect`
compare-function coverage is now COMPLETE), `EnvironmentMapEffect.FresnelFactor` with a genuine
per-vertex gradient, **ALL 3** `SkinnedEffect.WeightsPerVertex` values (`1`/`2`/`4` —
`SkinnedEffect` weighting coverage is now COMPLETE), `SpriteBatch`'s core draw path, sampler
address modes, 3 of 5 `SpriteSortMode` values, and multi-texture `FlushBatch()`-on-texture-change
batching (`D9-90`/`D9-91`/`D9-92`/`D9-93` all now CLOSED), and **ALL 4** `PrimitiveType` values
(`TriangleList`/`TriangleStrip`/`LineList`/`LineStrip` — `PrimitiveType` coverage is now
COMPLETE), every comparison pixel-perfect; `D9-84` (every draw path validated against the oracle)
can now genuinely continue, one scene at a time.

**Phase D9-9: `D9-90`–`D9-93` all closed 2026-07-15 — `D3D9SpriteBatchBackend` is real, the
half-pixel offset is both oracle- and mutation-verified, `Wrap`/`Mirror` addressing are both
oracle-verified with genuinely distinguishing patterns, and 3 of 5 `SpriteSortMode` values are
oracle-verified with a real backend bug found and fixed along the way.** See Phase D9-9's own
section above for the full record, including a real finding about why the FIRST mutation-test
attempt for `D9-91` (boundary check alone) would have been a false-positive "closed" claim, and
`D9-93`'s own Z-clipping bug (`BuildMatrixTransformEXT`'s `zFarPlane=1` silently clipped away any
sprite with `layerDepth > 0`, fixed with `zFarPlane=-1`). Phase D9-9 has no open rows left;
`SpriteSortMode.Immediate`/`.Texture` remain explicitly out of scope, not silently assumed.

**New blocker found 2026-07-15, NOT fixed, reverted to keep the tree clean — a real D3D9 backend
crash when a `D3DUSAGE_RENDERTARGET`-flagged `RenderTarget2D` texture exists in-process alongside
any subsequent draw call.** While attempting to add the corpus's first render-target oracle scene
(`rendertarget_texture_quad.scene` — create a `RenderTarget2D`, `SetRenderTarget`/`Clear`/unbind
it, then use it as a `BasicEffect` texture for an ordinary textured quad), `cna_oracle_render.exe`
crashes with `terminate called after throwing an instance of 'dxvk::DxvkError'` — an UNCAUGHT
exception (this file's own `main()` already has a `catch (const std::exception&)` around the
entire `Game::Run()` call; the crash bypasses it entirely, meaning the throw happens on a
different thread, most likely one of DXVK's own async shader-compiler threads: `DXVK_LOG_LEVEL=
trace` + `DXVK_LOG_PATH=...` showed the crash lands immediately after `debug: Compiling shader
FS_...`, with nothing more written to the log).

**Isolated via bisection, not guessed:**
- Reproduces regardless of render target SIZE (tried `1×1` and `4×4`).
- Reproduces regardless of whether the render target is ever bound, cleared, or unbound at all —
  a version that only *constructs* a `RenderTarget2D` (`new RenderTarget2D(dev, w, h)`) and never
  calls `SetRenderTarget`/`Clear` on it still crashes identically on the next ordinary draw call.
- Reproduces regardless of whether the render-to-texture happens in the same frame or a frame
  earlier (tried deferring the RT construction to frame N-1 and the texture-sampling draw to
  frame N, relying on the framework's automatic `Present()` between `Draw()` calls as a
  synchronization boundary — no change).
- Every one of this corpus's other 19 scenes (none of which ever construct a
  `D3DUSAGE_RENDERTARGET`-flagged texture) pass pixel-perfect, including plain `Texture2D`-based
  textured-quad scenes using the exact same `BasicEffect`/`PositionTexture`/unlit/untextured-
  vertex-color shader bucket this new scene also uses — so the crash is specific to the presence
  of a `RenderTarget2D`-backed (`D3DUSAGE_RENDERTARGET`) texture object, not to texturing or this
  particular effect/shader bucket in general.
- `D3D9RenderTargetBackend::Recreate()`/`GetTextureEXT()` (`src/CNA/Internal/Backends/D3D9/
  D3D9RenderTargets.cpp`) both look correct on inspection: `CreateTexture(..., D3DUSAGE_RENDER
  TARGET, D3DFMT_A8B8G8R8, D3DPOOL_DEFAULT, ...)` (a real, sample-able D3D9 texture per the D3D9
  API contract, not a `CreateRenderTarget()` surface-only resource), `GetTextureEXT()` returns the
  same `colorTexture_.Get()` this creates. Nothing wrong was found by code inspection alone —
  this needs either Vulkan validation layers or DXVK-internals-level debugging to actually
  diagnose, beyond what this task's own scope justifies.
- **Not the same gap `CnaOracleRender.cpp`'s own header comment already documents** (that comment
  is about `RenderTarget2D::GetData()`'s CPU readback path being unproven) — this new scene never
  calls `GetData()` at all; the crash is in ordinary GPU-side texture *sampling* of a render
  target from within a normal effect draw, a different and previously totally untested code path
  (D9-53's own `D3D9_Smoke` Check S/T/U cover create/bind/Clear/`GetRenderTargetData`-readback/
  unbind-restores-back-buffer, never "use the render target as a sampled shader texture").

**Reverted, not committed**: all code (`CnaOracleRender.cpp`/`Oracle.cs` `rendertargettexture=`/
`rendertargetwidth=`/`rendertargetheight=`/`rendertargetclearcolor=` scene-key wiring) and the
new scene file were fully reverted (`git checkout --`) rather than landed half-working, per this
project's own "no half-finished implementations" rule — the working tree is clean, all 19
committed scenes still pass, `D3D9` CTest suite still 11/11 green. **Recommended next step for
whoever picks this up**: reproduce with Vulkan validation layers enabled
(`VK_LAYER_KHRONOS_validation` via `VK_INSTANCE_LAYERS`, if available in this environment) to get
an actual Vulkan-level diagnostic message instead of an opaque `dxvk::DxvkError`; alternatively,
compare against a minimal known-working D3D9 render-target-to-texture sample (outside this
project) on the same DXVK/driver stack to establish whether this is a genuine CNA-side bug or an
environment/DXVK-version limitation. Do not re-attempt the render-target oracle scene until this
is root-caused — a scene that "passes" by accident (e.g. by catching and silently swallowing the
crash) would be worse than no scene at all.

**RESOLVED 2026-07-16 — root-caused as a real CNA-side bug, not a DXVK/environment limitation;
fixed, no Vulkan validation layers ultimately needed.** Root cause found by code inspection once a
minimal repro was isolated at the `D3D9_DrawEx` CTest level (not the oracle harness — kept that
work out of scope for this fix, see below): every `D3D9EffectDraw.cpp` texture-binding call site
(`DrawBasicEffectEXT`/`DrawAlphaTestEffectEXT`/`DrawDualTextureEffectEXT`/
`DrawEnvironmentMapEffectEXT`/`DrawSkinnedEffectEXT`) did
`static_cast<const D3D9TextureBackend*>(params.texture0)` unconditionally. `GpuDrawParams::
texture0`/`texture1`/`envMap` are declared `const ITextureBackend*`/`const ITextureCubeBackend*`,
and `D3D9RenderTargetBackend`/`D3D9RenderTargetCubeBackend` (`IRenderTargetBackend : ITextureBackend`)
are real, legal runtime types for that pointer whenever a game samples a `RenderTarget2D`/
`RenderTargetCube` as an ordinary effect texture — exactly what the reverted oracle scene did. The
`static_cast` silently reinterpreted a `D3D9RenderTargetBackend*` (an unrelated sibling class, not
a base/derived relationship) as a `D3D9TextureBackend*`: undefined behavior that read whichever
field sits at `D3D9TextureBackend::texture_`'s own offset in a `D3D9RenderTargetBackend`'s actual,
different layout, handed `SetTexture()` a garbage `IDirect3DTexture9*`, and crashed later when
DXVK's async shader-compiler thread actually tried to use it — matching the observed symptom and
timing exactly (`SPIR-V`/shader-compile-adjacent crash, uncaught, off the main thread).

This project's own `D3D11GraphicsBackend.cpp` already had to solve the identical problem
(`GetSrvForTextureEXT`, a `dynamic_cast`-based two-concrete-type resolver) — `D3D9` simply never
got the equivalent. Fixed with `ResolveD3D9TextureEXT`/`ResolveD3D9TextureCubeEXT` (new, anonymous-
namespace-local helpers in `D3D9EffectDraw.cpp`, mirroring `D3D11`'s own precedent and its own
documented "duplicated per-file rather than factored into a shared header" rationale), replacing
all 6 unsafe `static_cast` call sites. `D3D9SpriteBatch.cpp` had the same category of gap in its
own texture resolve (already `dynamic_cast`-based, so it silently dropped the texture instead of
crashing) — fixed the same way for consistency, not because it was the crash's own cause.

**Mutation-verified, not just "compiles and doesn't crash the one time it was run"**: temporarily
reintroduced the exact original `static_cast` at the `DrawBasicEffectEXT` site and reran the new
regression check below — reproduced the EXACT documented symptom verbatim (`terminate called
after throwing an instance of 'dxvk::DxvkError'`); reverted, reconfirmed the fix passes. New
`D3D9_DrawEx` Check Q (18 checks total now): a `D3D9RenderTargetBackend` created/bound/`Clear()`ed
to a known color/unbound, then used directly as `params.texture0` for an ordinary unlit+textured
`BasicEffect` draw — exact readback of the render target's real cleared content (not garbage), no
crash. Full `ctest -L D3D9`: 17/17 green, zero regressions.

**Deliberately did NOT re-attempt the reverted `rendertarget_texture_quad.scene` oracle-corpus
addition as part of this fix** — that's `D9-A5`/`D9-84`'s own territory (a separate concern from
root-causing and fixing the crash itself), and picking it up here would have been exactly the kind
of scope drift this session was already corrected for once. Whoever next grows the oracle corpus
can now safely re-add a render-target-as-texture scene; the underlying crash is gone.

**Phase D9-8: `D9-80`–`D9-83` ALL CLOSED — real, verified dispatch for all 5 XNA Stock Effects plus
hardware instancing on this backend.** The shader-dispatch tables/formulas are transcribed and
tested, the `GpuDrawParams` audit is independently re-verified (2 of its 4 gaps turned out resolvable
with no `GpuDrawParams` change; the other 2 remain genuine cross-cutting blockers, not this plan's
call), this backend has drawn its first real, pixel-verified 3D triangle
(`DrawColoredPrimitives`/`DrawIndexedColoredPrimitives`, `BasicEffect`-VertexColor-only scope), draws
real effect-aware geometry for `BasicEffect`/`AlphaTestEffect`/`DualTextureEffect`/
`EnvironmentMapEffect`/`SkinnedEffect` (`DrawPrimitivesEx`/`DrawIndexedPrimitivesEx` — 10 of
`BasicEffect`'s 32 `ShaderIndex` values, all 8 of `AlphaTestEffect`'s, 2 of `DualTextureEffect`'s
4, 8 of `EnvironmentMapEffect`'s 16, and 12 of `SkinnedEffect`'s 18 are actually drawable given
this project's vertex layouts and `D9-81`'s still-open gaps — all pixel-verified), and now draws
real hardware-instanced geometry (`DrawInstancedPrimitivesEx` via `SetStreamSourceFreq`, CNA's own
NOXNA instancing shader since real XNA has no per-instance-aware Stock Effect shader). `D9-64` (reuse the backend-agnostic state CTest sources) is also now closed, finding and fixing 2
real, pre-existing D3D9 bugs along the way (`SetDepthTestEnabled`/`SetDepthWriteEnabled` silent-
throw stubs; `UpdatePresentationFormatEXT()`'s deferred-format-apply timing) — Phase D9-6 is now
fully closed too. Next smallest task: keep growing `D9-A5`'s scene corpus and validating each
scene against the oracle (`D9-84`, the last row in Phase D9-8) — the harness itself (`D9-A3`/
`D9-A4`) is done and its first result (`colored3d`) is pixel-perfect.
`PreferPerPixelLighting` variants (`BasicEffect`/
`SkinnedEffect`) and `EnvironmentMapEffect`'s specular variants stay blocked on a project-owner-level
`GpuDrawParams` decision (`D9-81`'s still-open findings). The `D3DCULL` winding trap (`D9-21`) did NOT
need to be worked around for `D9-82`/`D9-82b`–`f`/`D9-83` (explicit `CullMode::None` resets
sidestepped it, matching `D3D11_Smoke`'s own precedent) — it's still open, and `D9-84` may yet hit it
for real once culling-sensitive scenes are drawn.

## 5. Known bugs and limitations

- `BasicEffect` via `DrawPrimitivesEx` only supports 12 of its 32 `ShaderIndex` values (was 10,
  updated 2026-07-16 — see below) — every combination whose `VSInput` shape has no matching CNA
  vertex layout (Position-only 12 bytes; Position+Normal 24 bytes, colliding with the existing
  Position+Color+TexCoord layout; Position+Normal+Color[+TexCoord] 28/36 bytes) throws a named
  error instead of drawing. See `plan_dx9.md` `D9-82b`'s own closure note / `D3D9EffectDraw.cpp`'s
  header comment for the exact enumeration.
- **RESOLVED 2026-07-16 (`plan_graphics.md` Phase 80, project-owner-authorized cross-backend
  fix): `GpuDrawParams` now carries real `preferPerPixelLighting`/`specularEnabled` fields, and
  this backend's dispatch reads them instead of hardcoding `false`.** `BasicEffect`'s
  pixel-lighting-textured bucket (`ShaderIndex` 28/29) and `SkinnedEffect`'s entire pixel-lighting
  bucket (12-17, all 3 `WeightsPerVertex` values) are now reachable and oracle-proven pixel-perfect
  against real XNA (4 of `D9-73`'s own 5 divergent shader variants — see that row); the untextured
  bucket (`BasicEffect` `ShaderIndex` 24/25, `VSBasicPixelLighting`) stays permanently blocked by
  the SAME missing-vertex-layout gap as the untextured vertex-lit bucket above, unrelated to this
  fix. `EnvironmentMapEffect`'s specular buckets (all 8, `ShaderIndex` 4-7/12-15) are also now
  reachable — a real bug (constants uploaded to the wrong shader stage, or not at all for
  `EnvironmentMapSpecular`) was found and fixed along the way, see `plan_dx9.md` `D9-73`/`D9-84`'s
  own rows for the full record.
- `DualTextureEffect` via `DrawPrimitivesEx` only supports 2 of its 4 `ShaderIndex` values — the
  vertex-color variant (`VSInputTx2Vc`, 32 bytes) collides with the existing
  Position+Normal+TexCoord layout and throws a named error instead of drawing (`plan_dx9.md`
  `D9-82d`'s own closure note). Unaffected by the above (no `PreferPerPixelLighting`/
  `specularEnabled` concept in this effect).
- `D3DCULL` winding (`CullClockwiseFace`/`CullCounterClockwiseFace` vs. `D3DCULL_CW`/`_CCW`) is
  mapped but not yet pixel-proven against the real XNA oracle (`plan_dx9.md` `D9-21`/`D9-84`).

See `plan_dx9.md`'s "CNA's divergences from XNA 4.0" for the six pre-existing, cross-cutting
CNA-vs-XNA fidelity gaps this plan will measure (not fix) once Phase D9-A's oracle is complete.

**Two standing, project-wide architecture-decision items, unrelated to D3D9** (not this plan's to
decide — see `plan_graphics.md` for full detail): `Texture3D`/`TextureCube` inherit
`GraphicsResource` directly instead of `Texture` (Task 863); `GraphicsDevice` stores state objects
by value instead of FNA's reference-type aliasing (Task 869). Both need a project-owner direction
before any backend acts on them — see §9.

## 6. Architecture notes

### Main modules (D3D9-relevant)

| Layer | Location | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Backend contracts | `include/CNA/Internal/Backends/Common/IGraphicsBackend.hpp` | Being extended additively (approved) for D3D9's needs — see `plan_dx9.md`. |
| **D3D9 backend** | `include/\|src/CNA/Internal/Backends/D3D9/` | Windows-only, MinGW-w64 cross-compiled, own format/state/vertex-declaration mapping (not `D3DCommon`). Device/present/buffers/textures/render-targets/render-state/stock-effect-shaders/colored draws, all 5 XNA Stock Effect draws (`BasicEffect`/`AlphaTestEffect`/`DualTextureEffect`/`EnvironmentMapEffect`/`SkinnedEffect`), and hardware instancing (`DrawInstancedPrimitivesEx`) are real; `D9-84` (oracle validation)/`SpriteBatch` still pending. |
| Vendored XNA stock effects | `src/CNA/Internal/Backends/D3D9/shaders/xna/` (destination) | Microsoft's `.fx`/`.fxh`, verbatim, MS-PL. |
| Spike artifacts (temporary) | `dx9-spike/` | Proven Phase D9-0 code, being moved into the real tree task by task. |

### Critical invariants (do not break these)

Same project-wide invariants as `plan_dx.md`'s `NEXT.md` used to list (Doxygen/SPDX/NOXNA/property
convention/stride-keyed vertex layout/etc.) — see `CLAUDE.md` and `CHECKLIST.md`, not repeated here.
D3D9-specific invariants (from `plan_dx9.md` design decisions): plain D3D9 not D3D9Ex;
`D3DPOOL_MANAGED` for user resources; Microsoft's `.fx`/`.fxh` sources are never edited; shader
targets stay `vs_2_0`/`ps_2_0` for stock effects (never "upgraded" to SM3); no D3DX linked, ever.

### FNA / XNA reference

Authoritative behavioral reference for this backend is **not** FNA (FNA has no D3D9 driver) — it is
XNA itself, in two forms: Microsoft's Stock Effects HLSL sources
(`/rv/data/library/github.com/FNA-XNA/FNA/src/Graphics/Effect/StockEffects/`) for the shaders, and the
real XNA 4.0 runtime under Wine (`~/.wine-cna-xna40`, `tools/xna-oracle/`) for behavior.

## 7. Useful commands

```bash
# Wine prefixes (see dx9-spike/README.md for full detail)
~/.wine-cna-d3d9-spike   # real Microsoft d3dcompiler_47.dll -- shader compile work ONLY
~/.wine-cna-xna40        # real XNA 4.0 (win32, .NET 4.0, in-prefix csc.exe) -- the oracle
~/.wine-cna-d3d11        # D3D9 RUNTIME device tests use this one too (its own dxvk-setup install
                         # already wires d3d9.dll to DXVK) -- do not touch its D3D11/D3D12 CTest role

# Run a D3D9 .exe under Wine+DXVK, with the DXVK-marker gate (mirrors run-wine-dxvk.sh's DX-85 gate)
scripts/run-wine-dxvk9.sh path/to/some_d3d9_test.exe
# Override the prefix (defaults to ~/.wine-cna-d3d11): CNA_D3D9_WINEPREFIX=...
# Bypass the DXVK gate for a deliberate non-DXVK diagnostic: CNA_D3D9_ALLOW_WINED3D=1
# Skip the gate for a binary that never opens a device (e.g. a future D3D9_Common): CNA_D3D9_SKIP_DXVK_GATE=1

# Once D9-10 lands (CMake wiring), the configure command will mirror D3D11's:
cmake -S . -B cmake-build-d3d9 \
      -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=cmake/toolchains/mingw-w64.cmake \
      -DCNA_GRAPHICS_BACKEND=D3D9 -DCNA_BUILD_TESTS=ON
```

## 8. Next smallest tasks

**Phases D9-0 through D9-13 are ALL fully closed** (`D9-32`/`D9-34`/`D9-60`/`D9-62`/`D9-73`
honestly 🟨 — see their own plan rows for exactly what's deferred and why; `D9-73` is now 4/5
closed, only the permanently-blocked untextured `VSBasicPixelLighting` variant remains, see below).
**Phase D9-A's diff harness (`D9-A1`–`D9-A4`) is fully closed**, now 36 scenes deep, all
pixel-perfect (5 new since the 31-scene count above: `lit_textured_quad_pixellighting`,
`skinned_pixellighting_quad`/`_twobone_quad`/`_fourbone_quad`, `envmap_specular_quad`).

**`D9-81`'s `PreferPerPixelLighting`/`specularEnabled` `GpuDrawParams` gap is now RESOLVED, 2026-07-16**
(project owner authorized the full cross-backend fix, `plan_graphics.md` Phase 80, D3D9 first since
it needs no new shader — Microsoft's own `.fx` sources already have both shader families). This
backend's dispatch now reads the real values; `plan_dx9.md`'s `D9-73`/`D9-84` rows have the full
record, including a real bug found and fixed along the way (lighting constants uploaded to the
wrong shader stage for the pixel-lighting bucket, and a missing `EnvironmentMapSpecular` upload
entirely). **The remaining 8 backends (EasyGL/Vulkan/Bgfx/WebGPU/D3D11/D3D12/Software each need a
genuinely new per-vertex-lit shader; `SdlRenderer`/`Headless` don't render 3D lighting at all) are
`plan_graphics.md`'s own scope, not this plan's** — see that file's Phase 80 for the per-backend
task breakdown, sequenced one at a time by explicit project-owner request. **Phase D9-12 is
now fully closed, including `D9-123`** — `D9-120`/`D9-121`/`D9-122`/`D9-123` all ✅ (see §2's own
Phase D9-12 section for the full `D9-122`/`D9-123` detail, including the `gtest_discover_tests`
cross-compile fix and its own end-to-end verification). **`D9-130` (Phase D9-13 docs) is closed
too** — `docs/d3d9-backend.md`, a full `D3D9` column across all 7 tables in
`docs/graphics-backend-feature-matrix.md`, a `D3D9` build section + Tested-Compilers row in
`README.md`, and the `programs.md` §9 Wine-prefix gap it flagged are all done.

**Phase D9-11 (custom `ShaderEffect`) is authorized AND fully closed (2026-07-15)** — `D9-110`/
`D9-111`/`D9-112` all ✅, see §2's own Phase D9-11 section for the complete detail.

**`D9-A6` (run the oracle corpus against CNA's other backends) is now CLOSED too (2026-07-16)** —
measured EasyGL first: 10/31 scenes pixel-perfect (all `sprite_*` + `alphatest_never_quad`), 21/31
diverge across three evidenced patterns (a rasterization-boundary gap spanning 17 scenes, GPU/driver
floating-point rounding noise on 2 scenes, and 2 real, previously-unmeasured `plan_graphics.md`
candidates — `fog_gradient_quad`'s negative-`FogEnd` handling and `envmap_fresnel_quad`'s Fresnel
interpolation, the latter a concrete confirmation of this plan's own predicted `preferPerPixelLighting`
gap). Logged in `docs/d3d9-divergence-report.md`'s new "Cross-backend measurement (D9-A6)" section,
none fixed, per this row's own explicit "log them and move on" rule. Vulkan/D3D11 remain unmeasured
by this pass — the same recipe (a `cna_*_test`-style CMake registration + a
`run-oracle-corpus-diff-<backend>.sh` twin script) is the natural next step for either.

**Only `D9-140` (real Windows hardware verification) remains in this entire plan** — `needs_human`,
out of scope for this dev environment entirely. Every unilaterally-startable task in `plan_dx9.md`
is now closed (verified just now: `D9-A6`, the last one, is done above; the only other non-`✅` rows
in the whole plan are `D9-A5`/`D9-84`, both deliberately-ongoing "growing with the plan" 🟨 rows with
their own documented remaining scope, not blocked-and-unstarted work).

**Readiness re-audit, 2026-07-16 — accurate current punch list** (replaces this section's own prior
paragraph, which had gone stale: it still said "`EnvironmentMapEffect` specular/
`PreferPerPixelLighting` are blocked on `D9-81`'s cross-cutting `GpuDrawParams` gaps," contradicting
this very section's own "RESOLVED 2026-07-16" paragraph above it — that gap is fixed, not still
blocking). Every non-`✅` row in `plan_dx9.md` was re-read individually; here is what each one
actually still needs, if anything:

- **`D9-21` (`D3DCULL`) — CLOSED 2026-07-16.** 3 new oracle scenes (`cullmode_none_quad`/
  `cullmode_ccwface_quad`/`cullmode_cwface_quad.scene`, reusing `colored3d.scene`'s own triangle,
  a confirmed negative-NDC-signed-area winding per `docs/xna_culling_compatibility_audit.md`'s
  real-hardware-verified table) proved `CullModeToD3D9()`'s mapping against real XNA 4.0,
  `0/65536` each, mutation-verified (swapping the `CW`/`CCW` mapping reproduces the exact
  predicted failure). Corpus is now 39 scenes.
- **`D9-62` (`RasterizerState.DepthBias`/`SlopeScaleDepthBias`) — attempted, NOT closed.** A
  discriminating scene was designed and multiple magnitudes tried (`1.0` through `±1e8`) against
  the real XNA 4.0 oracle — none produced any observable pixel change, while a bias-free baseline
  confirmed the underlying depth test itself works. Likely shares a root cause with this project's
  own separate, pre-existing `Vulkan_DepthBias` CTest failure (same DXVK stack) — a suspected
  environment/driver limitation, not a CNA-side forwarding bug (unchanged, not suspected). See
  `D9-21`'s own plan row for the full investigation and the recommended next lead (try a real,
  non-identity perspective `Projection` — every scene in this corpus is `Identity` today).
- **`SurfaceFormat` sweep** (`plan_graphics.md` Phase 81) — scoped, not decided: needs a project-
  owner call on which formats justify the effort, and `Texture2D`'s own API needs new construction/
  `SetData` paths for non-`Color` formats before the oracle can even describe one. Not started.
- **`D9-A6` extended to Vulkan/D3D11** — offered, deferred by the project owner (2026-07-16). The
  same recipe already proven for EasyGL (a `cna_*_test`-style CMake registration + a
  `run-oracle-corpus-diff-<backend>.sh` twin script) is the natural next step whenever picked up.
- **Permanently blocked, not further actionable without new, larger, out-of-scope work**:
  `D9-73`'s 5th `PixelLighting` variant (untextured `VSBasicPixelLighting` — needs a Position-only
  vertex layout that doesn't exist); `D9-84`'s own full closure (blocked by `D9-62`'s `DepthBias`
  gap above, the `SurfaceFormat` sweep, plus `SpriteSortMode.Immediate`/`.Texture`, already
  confirmed out of scope for good reasons, not silently dropped); NPOT-wrap-on-`Reach` and
  hardware-instancing's `HiDef`-only gate (both need real XNA reference behavior this project has
  no way to verify — FNA implements neither; do not guess).
- **`D9-140` (real Windows hardware)** — the only item in the entire plan that is `needs_human`,
  out of reach in this dev environment entirely.
- A render-target-as-texture oracle scene can now safely be re-attempted (the crash blocking it is
  fixed, §4) but isn't itself a named remaining task — it would be new `D9-A5` growth, not a gap.

See `plan_dx9.md`'s "Execution order" table for the full sequence beyond this.

**Other standing backlog, unrelated to D3D9** (full history: `plan_dx.md` for the now-fully-closed
D3D11/D3D12 work, this file's own top banner for Phase 78):
- **`plan_samples.md` standing queue** (formerly Phase 79, `plan_graphics.md` Tasks 957–1076,
  moved+renumbered `SAMPLE-1`–`SAMPLE-120` on 2026-07-16): a full re-audit of all 153
  `../cna-samples`-catalogued samples, one row per sample. **13 rows** (`SAMPLE-32`/`33`/`34`/`35`/
  `36`/`38`/`39`/`40`/`42`/`43`/`45`/`62`/`66`) now say "No longer CNA-blocked" thanks to Phase 78
  — their own CNA-side shader gap is closed, but they're still `⬜` in `plan_samples.md` because
  **the actual sample port itself** (`.cpp`/`.hpp`/`Content/` under `../cna-samples/samples/<Name>/`)
  hasn't been written yet — that's a different repo, out of `cna_graphics` scope, tracked in
  `../cna-samples`'s own plan file. The other ~88 `⬜` rows in `plan_samples.md` are unrelated to
  shaders (re-verification passes, other DEFERRED.md items) — pick any of those, or any of the 13
  above if the sibling repo's own plan calls for it. Do not touch `⛔` rows (structural/permanent,
  no CNA action possible).
- Task 952 (`RenderTargetCube` depth-gating bug on Bgfx) remains **DEFERRED**, not a next task —
  see §9.

---

## 9. Do not do yet

- **Do not fix any of the six CNA-vs-XNA divergences** (`plan_dx9.md`'s own section) from inside this
  branch — measure with the oracle, report, propose to the project owner for a `plan_graphics.md`
  task. Never "just add the flag while in there."
- **Do not start Phase D9-11 (custom `ShaderEffect`)** without asking first — explicitly flagged
  optional/ask-first in `plan_dx9.md`'s execution order.
- **Do not edit Microsoft's vendored `.fx`/`.fxh` files**, ever, for any reason (`D9-70`).
- **Do not "upgrade" stock effects to `vs_3_0`/`ps_3_0`** because the hardware supports it.
- **Do not widen an oracle tolerance to turn a red test green** (`D9-A4`) — that silently converts
  this from an authenticity project into a parity project.
- **Do not touch `GpuDrawParams`, `D3DCommon/`, `D3D11/`, or `D3D12/`** — still off-limits regardless
  of branch state (cross-cutting or another backend's active territory).
- **Do not touch `IGraphicsBackend.hpp` beyond the approved additive extension** (new
  `GraphicsBackendCreateArgs` fields + the one device-event channel) — nothing else, no drive-by
  refactors.
- **`plan_dx.md` is entirely closed for both D3D11 and D3D12, through Phase DX16** (2026-07-15) —
  nothing left to authorize or implement there on this Debian machine. Only `DX-27`/`DX-90`/`DX-91`
  (D3D11) and `DX-110`/`DX-114` (D3D12) remain, all `needs_human` — a real Windows machine with a
  real GPU, or a real device-removed trigger neither backend can induce under Wine. **Do not open a
  "Phase DX17" or similar speculatively** — if the project owner wants more D3D work, they'll say so
  (e.g. the same way Phase DX16 itself started from an explicit percentage-audit request). Don't
  invent new gaps to close just because the plan file is open-ended in principle.
- **When working Phase DX12, do not merge D3D11 and D3D12 into one shared device/backend class**
  "for less duplication" — `plan_dx.md` design decision 4 already scoped what's genuinely shared
  (`D3DCommon`); forcing the actual device/command/resource logic to share code across two
  structurally different APIs is exactly the kind of premature abstraction `CLAUDE.md` warns
  against.
- **Do not assume D3D12 swap-chain/`Present()` support works locally under Wine "since D3D11's
  DXVK path worked"** — `DX-100`'s real spike found the opposite for presentation specifically
  (`CreateSwapChainForHwnd` crashes/fails under vanilla Wine's `dxgi.dll` + vkd3d-proton, even
  though the device/queue/command-list path itself is genuinely solid). Build `DX-102` onward
  around off-screen/readback proof and re-verify swap-chain support explicitly before relying on
  it, rather than inheriting D3D11's own assumption by analogy.
- **Do not resume Task 952** (Bgfx `RenderTargetCube` depth-gating bug) without explicit
  instruction — explicitly marked **DEFERRED** by the project owner after 2 full investigation
  rounds found no root cause.
- **Do not attempt Task 863 or Task 869** (the two architecture-decision items in §5) without the
  project owner picking a direction first.
- **Phase 78's `cna_graphics`-side shader-conversion work (Tasks 945/946/947/1079–1082) is DONE**
  (2026-07-16, explicit project-owner direction) — do not re-port any of the 13+1 already-closed
  shaders, and do not re-litigate Task 945's own decision (manual porting). What's still off-limits
  without new instruction: writing the actual sample ports themselves in the sibling `../cna-samples`
  repo — that's a different repo with its own plan file (not opened this session), genuinely outside
  `cna_graphics` scope, not merely "not yet started."
- **Do not chase `cna_demo_xact`'s build failure** — missing example asset directory, not a CNA bug.
- **Do not attempt `EasyGL_MRT_TwoAttachments`** opportunistically — pre-existing, off-limits
  without a dedicated task.
- **Do not run more than one backend's `ctest`/`CnaTests` suite concurrently** — causes spurious
  `Subprocess aborted` failures from resource contention, not real bugs.
- **Do not bundle multiple task numbers into one commit** — one task per commit, staged by explicit
  filename (never `git add -A`/`.`).
- **Do not claim indistinguishability from Wine+DXVK results alone** — `D3DCAPS9` under DXVK is
  synthesized, not driver-reported, and device-lost rarely fires naturally under Wine. Real hardware
  verification is `D9-140`, `needs_human`.

---

## 10. Resume prompt

```
Read NEXT.md first (this file, feature/dx9 branch), then plan_dx9.md in full before touching any
code -- this is a much stricter plan than the other CNA backends (indistinguishability from real
XNA 4.0, verified against a real oracle, not just "renders plausibly").

Implementation is authorized through Phase D9-13. The IGraphicsBackend boundary problem is resolved
(additive GraphicsBackendCreateArgs extension + device-event channel, approved 2026-07-14). Phase
D9-11 (custom ShaderEffect) still needs an explicit ask before starting. Phase D9-14 needs real
Windows hardware, out of reach here.

Pick exactly one task from §8 "Next smallest tasks" (default to the first one unless told
otherwise; the D3D9 punch list is exhausted down to `needs_human` rows, so also consider the
"Other standing backlog, unrelated to D3D9" items at the end of that section). Inspect only the
files that task names -- do not go exploring unrelated modules, and do not refactor anything you
find along the way that isn't directly required for this task. See §9 for what stays off-limits
generally.

Make one small, verified improvement:
1. Investigate/reproduce first (run the exact command named in the task).
2. Implement the smallest correct thing per plan_dx9.md's design decisions -- do not improvise past
   what the plan already decided.
3. Where the task is a rendering/behavior claim, verify it against the real XNA 4.0 oracle
   (tools/xna-oracle/, ~/.wine-cna-xna40), not just "looks right" -- that is this plan's whole
   point.
4. Update plan_dx9.md's own task table (status + notes) with the real result.
5. Update this NEXT.md: Sec.2/Sec.3/Sec.8, following the same short-index style as the rest of the
   file -- do not let it grow into a duplicate of plan_dx9.md.
6. Commit (staged by explicit filename, one task per commit), following this repo's existing
   commit-message style (git log --oneline).

Do not start a second task in the same session unless the first is fully closed, tested, and
committed, and NEXT.md/plan_dx9.md are updated.
```
