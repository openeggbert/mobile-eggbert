"""Builds CNA's placeholder avatar animations as Blender Actions keyframed directly on
the Task 11.1 `CNAAvatarSkeleton` bones. Simple bone rotations only: no motion capture,
no external clip source. Because this script shares the Task 11.1 bone names by
construction (it poses `generate_skeleton.BONES` directly), there is no retargeting
step — every keyframe just names a bone from that list.

Task 11.6 authored `Stand0` (idle) and `Wave`. Task 11.15 adds three more, working
toward covering more of `AvatarAnimationPreset`'s 31 values (still a small fraction —
these remain placeholder motion, not a claim of full coverage): `Stand1` (a second,
differently-shaped idle), `Clap`, and `Celebrate`.

Action names must match `AvatarAnimationPreset` enumerator names exactly (see
`AvatarAnimationPresetToClipNameEXT` in
include/Microsoft/Xna/Framework/GamerServices/AvatarAnimationPresetNamesEXT.hpp) since
that is the lookup key `AvatarRenderer::DrawRealEXT` uses against a loaded
`SkinnedModelEXT`'s clips — `Stand0`/`Stand1`/`Wave`/`Clap`/`Celebrate` already are exact
matches.

**A real, non-obvious empirical finding from Task 11.15 (verified by rendering, not
derived analytically — see `_raise_upper_arm`/`_fold_lower_arm` below):** mirroring an
arm gesture from the `.R` bones (as Task 11.6 authored for `Wave`) onto the matching
`.L` bones is NOT just "reuse the same signed angle" for every bone, and worse, testing
each joint *in isolation* gives a wrong answer for one of the two joints involved.
`UpperArm.L/R`'s "raise the arm up and back" axis (local Z) needs an **opposite-signed**
angle between `.L` and `.R` for the same physical motion (`UpperArm.R` raise = `Z(-A)`,
`UpperArm.L` raise = `Z(+A)`), confirmed consistently whether tested alone or combined
with a forearm fold. `LowerArm.L/R`'s "fold the elbow" axis (local X) tests as
opposite-signed too **if posed alone** (T-pose otherwise) — but once the matching
`UpperArm` is actually raised (the real context this rig is posed in), both sides need
the **same** sign instead. The reason: a child bone's local rotation composes with its
parent's *current* world transform, not its rest transform, so the same local angle can
swing a different way in world space once the parent has already rotated — an isolated
single-bone test silently assumes the parent is still at rest, which does not hold once
an arm is actually raised. Always re-verify empirically in the actual combined pose a
new call site uses, not bone-by-bone in isolation, and don't assume this pattern
generalizes to bones this script hasn't yet mirrored (`UpperLeg`/`LowerLeg`, etc.).
