"""Builds CNA's minimal placeholder avatar materials — one simple base-color Principled
BSDF material per body part (skin, hair, shirt, pants, shoes). No texture painting at
this stage; each material is a flat, project-chosen base color, meant to be replaced or
texture-painted in a later iteration (see plan_net.md Phase 11c, Task 11.13+).

Only the `Skin` material is assigned anywhere right now — `CNAAvatarBody` (the only mesh
that exists so far, Task 11.2). `Hair`/`Shirt`/`Pants`/`Shoes` are created and returned
for `generate_hair.py`/`generate_clothes.py` (Task 11.5) to assign to the mesh objects
they create; there is no hair/clothing geometry to assign them to yet.

Offline, one-time content-authoring tool — not part of the C++ build, never run by CNA
at runtime. Run headless via Blender:

    blender --background --python generate_materials.py

`generate_avatar.py` (Task 11.7) will import build_materials()/assign_body_material()
from this module and call them in the same Blender process as
generate_skeleton.build_skeleton() and generate_body.build_body(), rather than
re-deriving the materials.
