"""Task 7.4/7.5 (plan_net.md Phase 7): builds CNA's procedural avatar body via the sibling
`../mesh-craft` tool instead of `generate_body.py`'s bpy-primitive construction, per decision 4b
("Body/head ... geometry should be generated as glTF via the sibling ../mesh-craft tool going
forward"). Replaces `generate_body.build_body()` as a drop-in: same signature, same BODY_NAME
contract, same return value, same `fix_automatic_weights` post-process — only how the mesh
*geometry* itself is authored differs.

Data flow (documented once here, per Task 7.4's own requirement):
    generate_skeleton.BONES (Z-up meters)
      -> bones_to_mc3_xml() remaps to mc3's Y-up frame and writes a real .mc3.xml document
         (one <capsule> per limb segment - see "Why capsules, not cylinder+sphere" below)
      -> mc3togltf (external binary, built from ../mesh-craft) evaluates it to a .glb
      -> bpy.ops.import_scene.gltf() imports that .glb into the *same* Blender session
         generate_skeleton.build_skeleton() already populated (Blender's own importer performs
         the standard Y-up -> Z-up remap automatically, landing the geometry back in exactly the
         same frame generate_skeleton.py's BONES table already uses)
      -> imported mesh objects are joined into one BODY_NAME object (matching
         generate_body.build_body()'s own existing contract)
      -> parented to armature_obj with automatic (heat-map) weights, then
         generate_body.fix_automatic_weights() runs unchanged (reused, not reimplemented)

Why capsules, not cylinder+sphere (Task 7.3's own audit finding): the old pipeline built one
cylinder *and one separate joint sphere* per bone, then only `bpy.ops.object.join()`'d them - an
object-datablock merge, not a real weld/boolean-merge, confirmed as the root cause of the
self-intersecting hip/crotch mesh (worst where the most primitives converge). A single `<capsule>`
per bone already has a real, watertight rounded cap built in - no separate sphere, no seam between
a flat cylinder end and a mismatched sphere. mesh-craft's plain `<cone>` primitive (this format
version, 0.3) has no radius1/radius2 frustum form, so true smooth per-segment taper isn't directly
available without CSG (which drops real UVs on its evaluated output - see MC3_FORMAT.md's own CSG
limitations) - properly-sized *untapered* capsules are this pass's deliberate, documented scope
boundary; true taper is a follow-up, not attempted here.

Offline, one-time content-authoring tool - not part of the C++ build, never run by CNA at
runtime. Requires an already-built `mc3togltf` binary (see ../mesh-craft's own README) - path
resolved via the MC3TOGLTF environment variable, falling back to a few conventional build-output
locations relative to this repo's own working copy.

    comment: "Convert Manifold -> MeshData (flat face normals, no UVs)"), with duplicated
    coincident vertices at every merge seam (one vertex copy per adjacent flat-shaded triangle).
    On a rounded, capsule-based body this is not just a "faceted low-poly look" (this module's
    own earlier docstring assumed) - at CSG union seams, some of those flat per-triangle normals
    end up pointing at a steep/grazing angle relative to the single fixed directional light this
    project's avatar demos use, rendering as near-black patches (confirmed by direct fresh
    screenshot inspection at the neck, shoulder-to-arm junctions, groin, and - worst - a large
    dark mass across the chest during the Wave animation).

    **Correction (2026-07-18, second-round independent audit):** a first version of this function
    called `remove_doubles` + `shade_smooth()` and was verified only from a single, narrow camera
    angle - a second, wider-angle/different-pose check (`--yaw 25` during `Wave`) found the
    artifacts were still substantially present. Root cause of *that*: Blender's glTF importer
    loads mc3togltf's exported NORMAL accessor as **custom split normals** (confirmed directly:
    `mesh.has_custom_normals` reads `True` after import), which silently override the per-polygon
    smooth-shading flag `shade_smooth()` sets - both in Blender's own viewport/render and in
    whatever gets re-exported afterward. `shade_smooth()` alone was therefore close to a no-op on
    the actual rendered/exported result; welding coincident vertices was real (confirmed: ~5900
    removed) but bought little visually since the stale flat custom normals persisted regardless
    of the shared-vertex topology underneath them. Fixed by explicitly clearing the custom split
    normals (`mesh.customdata_custom_splitnormals_clear` before the final smooth-shading pass), so
    Blender actually computes and exports fresh smooth normals from the (now welded) topology.

    Task 7.5's own real finding: separate-but-visually-overlapping primitives (even properly
    rounded capsules, not the old cylinder+mismatched-sphere combo) still show dark
    self-intersection artifacts at every joint where 2+ segments converge - confirmed by direct
    visual inspection of the capsule-only prototype's own screenshots. A real CSG union (evaluated
    by mesh-craft's Manifold-backed exporter) produces one genuinely merged, watertight surface
    instead - the only way to eliminate this class of defect outright, not just shrink it.

    CSG's own documented cost - "UV coordinates are not real" on the evaluated result (see
    MC3_FORMAT.md) - is a non-issue for this specific asset: `CNAAvatarBody.png` is a solid 4x4
    white placeholder (Task 11.19), confirmed by direct pixel inspection to carry zero real
    per-pixel detail already; the avatar's actual skin color comes from a runtime tint

    costs nothing visually.
