// Task P9-HARDWARE-005: a small standalone (non-GTest) executable that forces SDL_AUDIODRIVER to
// a driver name that does not exist, before anything in this fresh process ever touches SDL
// audio, then calls a real XNA-facing audio entry point to prove NoAudioHardwareException is
// genuinely thrown when SDL3_mixer's device can't be opened. The shared CnaTests binary cannot
// exercise this path: CNA::Internal::Audio::AudioMixer.cpp's g_mixer is a process-wide,
// once-ever-initialized cache, and SDL only reads SDL_AUDIODRIVER the first time SDL_Init
// (SDL_INIT_AUDIO) runs in a process (see plan_audio.md P9-HARDWARE-002/005's notes; confirmed
// against third_party/SDL/src/audio/SDL_audio.c's driver-selection loop and
// third_party/SDL_mixer/src/SDL_mixer.c's MIX_CreateMixerDevice, which is what actually calls
// SDL_Init(SDL_INIT_AUDIO) -- MIX_Init() itself never touches the audio subsystem).
//
// SoundEffect::getMasterVolumeProperty() is used as the trigger: a static property getter that
// calls GetMixerOrThrowXna() as its very first action, needing no file/buffer/instance setup at
// all (SoundEffect.cpp, wired by P9-HARDWARE-002).
//
// Exit codes: 0 = NoAudioHardwareException thrown as expected, 1 = no exception thrown (audio
// device was unexpectedly available in this environment, or a real regression), 2 = the wrong
// exception type was thrown.
