"""Converts a MakeHuman body export + Mixamo animation clips into CNA's
.skinnedmodel.json / .skeleton.bin / .clip.bin content format for the
AvatarRenderer real-rendering extension (see docs/avatar-real-rendering-ext.md).

This is an offline, one-time asset-preparation tool — it is not part of the C++ build and is
never run by CNA itself at runtime.

Pipeline (see README.md for the manual steps this depends on):
  1. Export a MakeHuman body with the built-in "Mixamo" skeleton preset to FBX.
  2. Download the Mixamo animation clips listed in README.md's substitution table, each as FBX,
     retargeted onto a MakeHuman-compatible skeleton.
  3. Convert every FBX to glTF2 with the assimp CLI (normalizes FBX-exporter differences):
       assimp export body.fbx body.glb -f gltf2
       assimp export Wave.fbx Wave.glb -f gltf2
  4. Run this script:
       python3 convert_avatar.py --body body.glb --out content/avatar/male \\
           --clip Wave.glb Wave --clip Clap.glb Clap ...

Requires: pygltflib (pip install pygltflib) and Pillow (pip install Pillow, Task 11.19's
placeholder texture output). Does NOT require assimp's Python bindings — glTF2 parsing is
done directly via pygltflib, which has better animation/skin support than assimp's own
Python wrapper.
