# CNA Input — FNA Fidelity Notes

> **Related input docs (INP-0003):** [plan](../plan_input.md) · [backend](input-backend.md) · [FNA fidelity + deviations](input-fna-fidelity.md) · [member-parity matrix](input-member-parity-matrix.md) · [frozen API + tier glossary](input-public-api-frozen.md) · [test coverage](input-test-coverage.md) · [build & test](input-build-and-test.md) · [platform notes](platform-input-notes.md) · [manual results](input-manual-verification-results.md) · [demo checklist](demo-input-checklist.md)

CNA's `Input` namespace uses **FNA** (`Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Input` + its SDL platform layer) as
the authoritative behavioral reference. This document records, per input area: (a) behavior that
matches FNA, (b) **intentional** CNA deviations (with the reason), and (c) known **gaps / TODO**.
It reflects the Phase I13/I14 code-vs-FNA audit (tasks 954–956).

CNA is partially derived from / behaviorally based on FNA (see the repository's attribution/licensing
notes); those notices are intact and must not be removed.

## Architecture note (task 953)

FNA is **poll-based**: each frame it re-reads the full device state from SDL
(`SDL_GetKeyboardState`, `SDL_GetGamepad*`, `SDL_GetTouchFingers`, …). CNA is **event-driven**:
`SdlInputBridge::ProcessEvent` translates each SDL event and mutates `InputManager`'s accumulated
state; `Get*State()` reads that snapshot. Input state is therefore updated **at the moment each SDL
event is processed** (during the host's event pump), not sampled once per frame. The two models are
behaviorally equivalent for well-formed SDL event streams; the differences below are where they are
not exactly identical.

## Keyboard

| Aspect | Status |
|---|---|
| `Keys` enum numeric values | **Matches FNA exactly** (all values, incl. hex outliers `Pause`=0x13, `Kana`=0x15, `ChatPadGreen`=0xCA, `OemCopy`=0xf2, …). |
| SDL keycode/scancode → `Keys` maps | **Faithful port** of FNA `INTERNAL_keyMap`/`INTERNAL_scanMap`. |
| `NONUSHASH`/`NONUSBACKSLASH` (ISO-layout extra keys) | **Dropped**, not marked `Keys::None` — DEC-16-consistent (INPUT-KBD-011). See "Intentional deviations" below. |
| `GetPressedKeys()` ordering, `GetHashCode`, `this[Keys]` | Matches FNA (ascending numeric order; 8×32-bit XOR hash). |
| Repeated key-down while already down | State de-dupes (`unordered_set`) — matches FNA. |
| Key-up without prior key-down | No-op — matches FNA. |
| Focus-loss keyboard reset | **Neither FNA nor CNA clears keys on focus loss** (DEC-15: match FNA, accepted). See "SDL bridge" below for the event-driven consequence. |

**Intentional deviations:**
- **DEC-16 (accepted):** unmapped keycodes (`'é'`, `SDLK_UNKNOWN`) are **dropped** rather than pushed as
  `Keys::None`. FNA's `ToXNAKey` returns `Keys.None` and then does `Keyboard.keys.Add(Keys.None)`
  (`SDL3_FNAPlatform.cs:905-908`), leaving a meaningless "None" key marked pressed; CNA's drop is cleaner.
  Tested (`UnmappedKeycodeIsDroppedNotMarkedNone`).
- **INPUT-KBD-011/019 (accepted, extends DEC-16 to the scancode path):** scancodes with no XNA `Keys`
  value are **dropped** (`std::nullopt`) rather than mapped to `Keys.None`, so — exactly as DEC-16 for
  keycodes — `Keys::None` never enters the pressed set. This covers the no-scancode sentinel
  `SDL_SCANCODE_UNKNOWN` (matching the keycode path's `SDLK_UNKNOWN` drop) and the two ISO-layout extra
  keys `SDL_SCANCODE_NONUSHASH` / `SDL_SCANCODE_NONUSBACKSLASH`, which FNA maps to `Keys.None` (with its
  own `FIXME: … need verification`, `SDL3_FNAPlatform.cs:2615-2617`) and adds to its pressed list. FNA is
  the authoritative reference for the *value* (there is no better XNA mapping — CNA does not invent a
  divergent `OemBackslash`), but the pressed-set-pollution policy follows DEC-16, not FNA. Tested
  (`IsoLayoutExtraScancodesAreDroppedNotMarkedNone`).
- **DEC-17 (accepted):** `SDLK_AC_BACK` → `Keys::Escape` (Android/browser Back button) — a CNA-only
  convenience not in FNA, so "back" acts as cancel/exit on those platforms. Tested
  (`AndroidBackButtonMapsToEscape`).
- **DEC-19 (accepted — matches FNA):** text-synthesis on key-down re-emits control chars gated on SDL's
  `repeat` flag — **the same gate FNA uses** (`else if (evt.key.repeat)`, `SDL3_FNAPlatform.cs:923`), so
  this is not a deviation. Tested (`KeyRepeatReemitsControlCharacter`).

**XNA `Keys` with no desktop SDL source (INPUT-KBD-015 / -016 / -017 — matches FNA):** several `Keys`
values exist in the enum (exhaustively value-pinned by INPUT-KBD-001 / INPUT-API-034) but are never
produced by a desktop SDL event, exactly as in FNA (whose `keyMap`/`scanMap` omit them too — confirmed
byte-for-byte by INPUT-KBD-009/010):
- **IME keys** — `Kana` (21), `Kanji` (25), `ImeConvert` (28), `ImeNoConvert` (29), `ProcessKey` (229):
  Windows IME virtual keys with no SDL keycode/scancode; IME text reaches games via `TextInputEXT`.
- **ChatPad keys** — `ChatPadGreen` (202), `ChatPadOrange` (203): Xbox 360 ChatPad console-only keys with
  no desktop hardware/SDL source.
- **Browser / media keys** — `BrowserBack`…`BrowserHome` (166–172), `MediaNextTrack`…`MediaPlayPause`
  (176–179), `LaunchMail`/`SelectMedia`/`LaunchApplication1|2` (180–183), etc.: present in the enum, but
  the **only** media keys CNA/FNA map from SDL are `VolumeUp`/`VolumeDown`. The rest (SDL delivers
  `SDLK_MEDIA_*`, `SDLK_AC_HOME/SEARCH`, …) are dropped. Tested
  (`SdlMediaBrowserKeysAreUnmappedExceptVolumeMatchingFna`, `ImeAndChatPadKeysExistAndAreConsoleOrImeOnly`).

## Mouse

| Aspect | Status |
|---|---|
| Button → `ClickedEXT` index (`button-1`, down-only) | **Matches FNA exactly.** |
| `SetPosition` relative-mode early-return | **Matches FNA.** |
| `SetPosition` with null window | Safe no-op warp; caches requested position. |
| Wheel `×120` scaling | **Matches FNA** (cast-to-int **before** ×120 — whole notches only; task 927). |

**Intentional deviations:**
- **Wheel:** fixed in Phase I13/I14 to truncate the SDL float to a whole notch before scaling, so
  `ScrollWheelValue` stays a clean multiple of 120 exactly like XNA. (Previously multiply-then-cast
  leaked sub-notch precision-wheel motion.)
- **DEC-18 (superseded by N-005, corrected 2026-07-17/P1-018):** SDL's horizontal wheel (`wheel.x`) was
  originally dropped entirely — XNA/FNA `MouseState` exposes only the vertical `ScrollWheelValue`, so
  there was no property to route horizontal scroll to. N-005 added a NOXNA/EXT field instead: `wheel.x`
  is now scaled to the same 120-unit notch and surfaced via
  `MouseState::getHorizontalScrollWheelValueEXTProperty()`
  (`InputManager::AddHorizontalScrollWheelDelta`, wired in `SdlInputBridge::ProcessEvent`). It is
  deliberately excluded from `Equals`/`GetHashCode`/`ToString`/`==`/`!=` so those stay byte-identical to
  FNA. Tested in `SdlInputBridgeMouseTests.cpp` (horizontal-wheel delta/accumulation tests) and
  `MouseInputTests.cpp` (`NineArgConstructorAlsoSetsHorizontalScrollWheelEXT`,
  `HorizontalScrollWheelEXTIsExcludedFromEqualityAndHash`). This entry previously cited a test,
  `HorizontalWheelIsIgnored`, that no longer exists in the repo — the doc had gone stale relative to the
  N-005 change; corrected here.
- **`MouseState::GetHashCode()` (P1-018):** hashes `x_ ^ (y_*31) ^ (scrollWheelValue_*17)`
  (unsigned-wraparound arithmetic to avoid signed-overflow UB) vs. FNA's `return base.GetHashCode();`
  (`MouseState.cs:173-180`), which delegates to `ValueType.GetHashCode()` — a CLR-internal,
  reflection-based algorithm with no fixed, reproducible formula. Deliberate; same pattern already
  accepted for `GamePadState::GetHashCode()` above. Consistent with the `GetHashCode` contract (equal
  states hash equal — `GetHashCodeIsConsistentForEqualStates` in `MouseInputTests.cpp`); button states
  and the horizontal wheel EXT field are intentionally excluded from the formula, matching `Equals`'s
  exclusion of the EXT field.

### MouseCursor

No FNA source exists for `MouseCursor` — confirmed by full-tree search of
`/rv/data/library/github.com/FNA-XNA/FNA`. It is a MonoGame-derived NOXNA extension
(`include/Microsoft/Xna/Framework/Input/MouseCursor.hpp`), audited against MonoGame's
`MouseCursor.cs`/`MouseCursor.SDL.cs` for task P1-017. Full stock-cursor parity confirmed (all 12:
Arrow, IBeam, Wait, Crosshair, WaitArrow, SizeNWSE, SizeNESW, SizeWE, SizeNS, SizeAll, No, Hand). CNA
intentionally improves on MonoGame's actual SDL-backend behavior by making `Dispose()` a no-op for the
stock-cursor singletons (`isSystemSingleton_` guard) — real MonoGame's `PlatformDispose()` frees the
shared handle unconditionally, corrupting the singleton for all other holders. No accidental
divergences found; move ctor/assignment (a pure C++ addition, no C# analogue) reviewed line-by-line,
self-move-assignment guard now covered by a regression test.
- **Disposed-cursor behavior deviates from the project's general `IDisposable` convention (P3-033,
  accepted):** `MouseCursor::Dispose()` (`MouseCursor.cpp:208-227`) never throws, and — unlike the
  CLAUDE.md-documented default ("throw `std::runtime_error` if used after disposal") — no accessor on
  a disposed `MouseCursor` throws either: `GetSDLCursor()` simply returns the now-null pointer, and
  `Mouse::SetCursor` on a disposed cursor is an intentional safe no-op (tested by
  `SetCursorIsSafeNoOpForDisposedCursor`). This is deliberate: MonoGame's own `MouseCursor` (the
  source this NOXNA type is modeled on) defines no post-Dispose exception contract either, and a
  cursor object's only operations are read-only/pass-through (unlike, say, a `Stream`, where
  use-after-dispose hides a real resource-safety bug worth surfacing loudly). `Dispose()` itself
  remains idempotent (double-dispose is a safe no-op — P3-034, tested by
  `DisposeReleasesHandleAndIsIdempotent`), which does follow the general convention.
- **`GetSDLCursor()` stays public `NOXNA` (P3-037, decided 2026-07-17):** the raw, non-owned
  `SDL_Cursor*` accessor was considered for demotion to an internal/friend-only accessor (Phase-0
  concern #2), but kept public because CNA backend code outside this class (e.g. a graphics backend
  wanting to inspect the active cursor) legitimately needs it, and — per P3-036 — the header already
  keeps the *type* opaque (`struct SDL_Cursor;` forward-declared only, no `<SDL3/SDL.h>` leak into the
  public XNA include tree) so exposing the accessor does not itself force consumers to depend on SDL
  headers. The returned pointer's "not owned by the caller" contract is documented on the method
  itself.
- **Logical→window scaling:** CNA converts logical→window at `SetPosition` time via the graphics
  backend (`TransformLogicalToWindow` / `SDL_RenderCoordinatesToWindow`); FNA scales at `GetState`
  read time. Equivalent for the common case (see INPUT-MOUSE-002 (decision a-0001)).
- **`ClickedEXT` is multicast (DEC-06, fixed 2026-07-05):** now a `System::MulticastAction<int>` matching
  FNA's `public static Action<int>` — `+=` adds subscribers, `=` replaces, `= nullptr` clears. (Was a
  single `std::function`; the second-subscriber-lost gap is closed.)
- **Relative-mode cache (DEC-14, accepted 2026-07-05):** the public
  `Mouse::getIsRelativeMouseModeEXTProperty()` reads SDL **live** (`SDL_GetWindowRelativeMouseMode`),
  matching FNA — there is no cache at the API boundary. Separately, the SDL-agnostic `InputManager` keeps
  its own `RelativeMode` flag to gate relative-delta accumulation/draining in `GetMouseState`; because
  `InputManager` must not depend on SDL, that flag is written by `Mouse::setIsRelativeMouseModeEXTProperty`
  (which updates SDL **and** `InputManager` together) rather than read from SDL. It cannot diverge through
  CNA's own API; it would only desync if a caller toggled SDL relative mode *directly*, bypassing the CNA
  setter — which is out of contract. Accepted as-is (having `InputManager` read SDL would break the
  input-layer/SDL boundary). The live round-trip and the delta behaviour are both tested.

## GamePad

| Aspect | Status |
|---|---|
| Dead-zone constants + math (independent/circular/none) | **Matches FNA exactly** (`7849`/`8689`/`30`). |
| Thumbstick Y-sign, trigger + stick normalization | **Matches FNA exactly** (`/32767` over the whole Sint16 range, `/-32767` for the inverted Y — see the L-015 fix below). |
| SDL button → `Buttons` mapping (all 21, incl. paddles/touchpad/guide) | **Matches FNA exactly.** |
| Duplicate add / unknown remove / no-free-slot | Safe; duplicate-add is **safer** than FNA (no leak). |
| `SetVibration`/`SetTriggerVibration`/`SetLightBar`/`GetGyro`/`GetAccelerometer`/`GetGUID` | **Faithful ports.** |
| `ToString()` | Matches FNA (type name). |

**Fidelity fix (L-015, source-logic audit 2026-07-06):** `normalize_stick_axis` divided the **negative**
half of the SDL stick range by **32768** while the positive half used 32767. FNA divides the **whole** range
by 32767 (`SDL3_FNAPlatform.cs:1814-1822`: `axis / 32767`, `axis / -32767` for Y). The endpoints agreed
(both give ±1 after clamping) but every non-endpoint negative sample diverged (e.g. `-16384` → `-0.5` in CNA
vs FNA's `-0.50001`). Now `normalize_stick_axis` = `clamp(value / 32767, -1, 1)` for the full range —
byte-identical to FNA. Pinned by `StickAxisNormalizationMatchesFnaDivisor`.

**Real bugs fixed in Phase I13/I14:**
- **`SDL_INIT_GAMEPAD` was never initialized** → no gamepad events were ever delivered. The gamepad
  subsystem is now initialized (idempotently, with the background-events hint) via
  `SdlInputBridge::EnsureGamepadSubsystemInitialized()`, so hot-plugged **and** already-connected pads
  become visible (tasks 907/908).
  - **Startup invariant:** `Game::DoInitialize()` calls it explicitly **once**, right after the
    graphics device is created and **before the first event pump and the first `Update()`** (both
    `Game::Run()` and `Game::RunOneFrame()` funnel through `DoInitialize()`). So a pad connected
    before frame one is enumerated by SDL from the start. `SdlInputBridge::ProcessEvent()` also calls
    it lazily as a **defensive fallback** for any host that pumps SDL events without Game's loop.
- **`GetCapabilities` cancelled active rumble**: it probed rumble support with
  `SDL_RumbleGamepad(0,0,0)` (which *stops* vibration). Now it reads non-mutating capability
  properties (`SDL_PROP_GAMEPAD_CAP_*`), so reading capabilities no longer cancels a game's
  `SetVibration` (task 922).

**Intentional / documented deviations:**
- `FNA_GAMEPAD_NUM_GAMEPADS` is clamped to **4** because `PlayerIndex` is the frozen XNA enum
  (One–Four); FNA leaves it unclamped. Behavior matches FNA for every usable value 0–4.
- **`PacketNumber`** increments on raw per-field changes (event-driven) rather than FNA's
  once-per-poll-on-processed-change. Honors the XNA contract (equal number ⟹ no visible change) for
  connect/button/coarse-axis; a raw axis wobble entirely within the dead-zone can still bump it.
- `GamePadState::GetHashCode()` hashes `buttons ^ packetNumber*31` (consistent for equal states) vs
  FNA's reflection-based `ValueType.GetHashCode()`. Deliberate; other sub-structs match FNA.
- **DEC-20 (accepted):** `GetGUID`/`GetCapabilities` are computed **live** each call rather than cached at
  connect like FNA. Same values for a connected controller (a timing/impl detail, not a behavioral gap);
  `GetCapabilities` also deliberately avoids the zero-magnitude rumble probe FNA's cache path implies
  (would cancel active vibration — INPUT-GAMEPAD-012).
- **`Buttons` (and every other `[Flags]`-equivalent `enum class` in Input) implements `|`/`&`/`~`/`|=`/`&=`
  but not `^`/`^=` (P1-002).** C# gives every enum bitwise `|`/`&`/`^`/`~` for free; C++ `enum class`
  needs each spelled out explicitly. XNA/FNA game code conventionally only ever combines
  (`a | b`) or tests (`(state & flag) == flag`) flag enums, never XORs them, and no CNA source or test
  does either. Accepted as intentionally incomplete relative to what C# *permits* but never *uses* —
  add `operator^`/`operator^=` if a real XOR use case appears, rather than pre-emptively.
- **Out-of-range `PlayerIndex` never throws (P1-003):** FNA's `SDL3_FNAPlatform.cs` gamepad accessors
  (`GetGamePadCapabilities`/`GetGamePadState`/`SetGamePadVibration`/`SetGamePadTriggerVibration`/
  `GetGamePadGUID`/`SetGamePadLightBar`/`GetGamePadGyro`/`GetGamePadAccelerometer`, lines 1796-2074)
  index a fixed `GAMEPAD_COUNT`-sized array with no bounds check, so an out-of-range `PlayerIndex` cast
  throws `IndexOutOfRangeException` in FNA. CNA bounds-checks in every delegation path
  (`InputManager::try_get_player_slot`, `SdlInputBridge::get_sdl_gamepad_for_player`) and returns the
  graceful disconnected/false/empty fallback instead — safer, deliberate, and already pinned by
  `GamePadInputTest.AxisValuesAreClampedAndInvalidPlayerReturnsDisconnectedState`.
- **`GamePad::LeftDeadZone`/`RightDeadZone`/`TriggerThreshold`/`ExcludeAxisDeadZone` are `NOXNA public`
  (P1-003):** FNA declares these `internal` (`GamePad.cs:21-23,132-147`), relying on same-assembly
  visibility so `GamePadThumbSticks.cs`/`GamePadTriggers.cs` can read them. C++ has no assembly-scoped
  visibility; CNA exposes them as `NOXNA`-tagged public statics on `GamePad` so `GamePadThumbSticks.cpp`/
  `GamePadTriggers.cpp` (separate translation units) can consume them — the correct translation of FNA's
  `internal`, not an accidental widening of the public surface.
- `GamePadButtons::buttons_` was public in the header (declared before `private:`) despite FNA's field
  being `internal`; fixed to `private` with the existing `friend struct GamePadState;` preserved for
  the same-assembly-style access `GamePadState`'s constructor needs (P1-004).
- **Struct-level audit (P1-005):** every property of `GamePadCapabilities` (25 XNA bool properties +
  `GamePadType` + 10 `…EXT` bool properties) was compared field-by-field against FNA
  (`GamePadCapabilities.cs`): names, order, defaults (all `false` / `GamePadType.Unknown`), and
  getter/setter shape. Zero divergences found. FNA's `internal set` maps to a public `NOXNA`-tagged
  setter (documented in the struct's own Doxygen comment) since C++ has no `internal` accessibility;
  all 10 EXT properties are correctly `NOXNA` on both getter and setter. No `VendorId`/`ProductId`
  properties exist on this struct in current FNA — only the 10 boolean `…EXT` flags. Test coverage
  (`GamePadTests.cpp`, `GamePadMappingTests.cpp`, `PublicApiInputSignatureFreezeTests.cpp`,
  `PublicApiInputCompileTests.cpp`) already exercises every getter/setter individually (default state,
  per-flag isolation, round-trip, partial-capability combinations) plus full signature-freeze pinning;
  no gaps found, no new tests added.
- **Struct-level audit (P1-010):** every member of `GamePadTriggers` was compared line-by-line against
  FNA (`GamePadTriggers.cs`): the public 2-arg constructor's `[0,1]` clamp, the private/friend 3-arg
  dead-zone constructor (`GamePadDeadZone.None` clamps only; any other mode runs
  `GamePad::ExcludeAxisDeadZone` before clamping, applied independently to `Left`/`Right`), the
  epsilon-tolerant `==`/`!=`/`Equals`, and `GetHashCode()`'s `Left.GetHashCode() + Right.GetHashCode()`
  formula. Zero divergences found beyond the two already-documented, pre-existing, codebase-wide
  patterns above (`Equals(object obj)` omission, unsigned-wraparound `GetHashCode()` summation). One
  test-coverage gap (not a behavior bug) was closed: the private dead-zone constructor's `Right`
  trigger path had no independent test — added
  `GamePadTriggersTest.NonNoneDeadZoneModeAppliesIndependentlyToBothTriggers`.

**Fake-SDL unit coverage (Phase I15 — no real hardware):** an internal injectable seam
(`ISdlGamepadBackend`, production = real SDL) lets a `FakeSdlGamepadBackend` drive the real
`SdlInputBridge` event path in tests. Now headless-tested: pre-connected visibility, duplicate add
(no leak/second slot), unknown remove, remove-closes-correct-handle + disconnect, `>4`
no-free-slot, `FNA_GAMEPAD_NUM_GAMEPADS` parsing + slot limits, **all 21** `SDL_GamepadButton`
mappings, axis Y-inversion + trigger normalization, connected/disconnected capabilities,
rumble/trigger/LED support true/false, **reading capabilities not cancelling active rumble**,
gyro/accel present/absent + read + graceful failure, and GUID formatting (xinput /
vendor+product little-endian / Valve overrides).

**Remaining gaps (real hardware / manual only — NOT a code gap):** the fake proves CNA's
*translation and bookkeeping* are correct; it cannot prove the *physical device acts* — an actual
rumble motor spinning, real trigger haptics, a real sensor's live values, or genuine OS hot-plug /
per-controller GUID. Those stay in `docs/input-manual-verification-results.md`, kept **separate**
from the fake-backend unit tests above.

## TouchPanel / TouchCollection / TouchLocation

| Aspect | Status |
|---|---|
| `GetState` previous-location (Pressed/Moved/Released) | Matches FNA (Phase I12). |
| `TouchLocation` `Equals`/`GetHashCode`/`==`/`!=` | **Matches FNA.** |
| `SDL_EVENT_FINGER_CANCELED` | **Fixed (task 892):** now released like `FINGER_UP` (was unhandled → stuck touch). |
| `GetCapabilities()` side effects | **Fixed (task 894):** now uses non-mutating `InputManager::HasAnyTouch()`; no longer consumes a touch frame. |
| `GetState()` read-frequency dependence | **Fixed (INP-AUD-001, 2026-07-16):** `TouchPanel::GetState()`/`InputManager::GetTouchState()` are now pure reads; see below. |
| `GetCapabilities()` SDL enumeration | **Fixed (INP-AUD-003, 2026-07-16):** now queries `system_device_backend().GetTouchDevices()` every call, matching FNA; see below. |
| `TouchCollection::CopyTo` | **Fixed (task 902):** out-of-range index now throws `std::out_of_range` (was UB). |
| `TouchCollection::FindById` not-found out-param | **Fixed (P1-022):** now writes the `Invalid` sentinel location (`TouchLocation(-1, Invalid, Vector2.Zero)`) on the not-found path — previously left the caller's out-param untouched. Matches FNA `TouchCollection.cs:125-130`. |
| Empty/default semantics, out-of-range indexer, `IsReadOnly=true` | Equivalent to FNA (empty vector replaces null sentinel; `out_of_range` for bad index). |

**Intentional / documented deviations:**
- **`TouchCollection::CopyTo` inserts rather than overwrites (P1-022):** FNA's `CopyTo`
  (`TouchCollection.cs:105-110`) delegates to `List<T>.CopyTo(T[] array, int arrayIndex)`, which
  overwrites pre-existing slots of a fixed-size destination array starting at `arrayIndex` and throws
  if there isn't enough room past that index. CNA's destination is a growable
  `std::vector<TouchLocation>&`, so `CopyTo` instead **inserts** the source elements at `arrayIndex`,
  shifting later elements right rather than overwriting them — an unavoidable consequence of the
  fixed-array-vs-growable-vector type difference. Out-of-range `arrayIndex` still throws
  `std::out_of_range` (task 902), matching FNA's `ArgumentOutOfRangeException` intent. Pinned by
  `CopyToAppendsAllElementsInOrder`, `CopyToFromEmptyCollectionIsANoOp`,
  `CopyToThrowsOnOutOfRangeIndexInsteadOfUndefinedBehavior`, `CopyToInsertsAtValidNonZeroIndex`.
- **`GestureSample`'s `NOXNA` default constructor seeds `FingerIdEXT`/`FingerId2EXT` with
  `TouchPanel::NO_FINGER` (P1-020):** a strict `default(GestureSample)` in C# would zero every field
  (`FingerIdEXT == 0`), but `0` is a legitimate real SDL finger id — a zero default would look
  ambiguously like "touching with finger 0" rather than "no finger". CNA deliberately uses the same
  `NO_FINGER` (-1) sentinel both FNA-parity constructors already use (`GestureSample.cs:93-94,
  117-118`) instead. Pinned by `GestureSampleTest.DefaultConstructorProducesZeroedNoneSample`.
- **Touch IDs** are a compact sequential counter (1,2,3,…) rather than FNA's cast SDL finger id. IDs
  are opaque to games. Overflow only after ~2³¹ distinct fingers in one session (theoretical).
- **`MAX_TOUCHES` / `MaximumTouchCount` (DEC-09 + DEC-10, fixed 2026-07-05):** now matches FNA on both
  counts. `GetCapabilities` reports `MaximumTouchCount = 4` (FNA: "MaximumTouchCount is completely bogus;
  for any touch device, XNA always reports 4", `SDL3_FNAPlatform.cs`), `0` when disconnected — this is a
  fixed XNA-compat value, NOT the tracking cap. `TouchPanel::GetState()` caps the public snapshot at
  `MAX_TOUCHES (8)`, matching FNA's fixed `TouchLocation[MAX_TOUCHES]` array (the event-driven
  `InputManager` map is internally unbounded, but the public state never exceeds 8).
- **Zero display size at startup (P5-014):** before `GraphicsDevice` publishes the virtual back-buffer
  size, `TouchPanel.DisplayWidth/Height` are `0`. The gesture path (`INTERNAL_onTouchEvent`, TouchPanel.cpp:188)
  **early-returns** when either is `<= 0`, so no touch collapses to a bogus `(0,0)`-corner gesture. Touch
  **presence** is still tracked, because the bridge records it via `SetTouchState(to_touch_pixel_position(...))`,
  which scales by the SDL **window** size (min 1×1), independent of the display metric. So at startup there is
  an **intentional** divergence — touch tracked, gestures suppressed — that resolves the instant a valid
  display size is published (gestures resume). Pinned by
  `SdlInputBridgeTouchGestureTest.TouchBeforeDisplaySizeIsKnownTracksTouchButSuppressesGestures` and
  `TouchEdgeCaseTest.ScalingProducesNoGestureWhenDisplaySizeIsZero`.
- **`GetCapabilities` SDL enumeration (INP-AUD-003, fixed 2026-07-16):** `TouchPanel::GetCapabilities()`
  now queries `CNA::Internal::Input::system_device_backend().GetTouchDevices()` on every call, matching
  FNA's `GetTouchCapabilities()` (`SDL_GetTouchDevices()` on every query, `SDL3_FNAPlatform.cs:2265-2280`).
  **Previously** it reported `IsConnected = false` for any touchscreen that had not yet been touched —
  it only ever consulted the sticky `touchDeviceExists_` flag (set on the first `FINGER_DOWN`,
  `SdlInputBridge.cpp:1428`) or the live `InputManager::HasAnyTouch()` peek, never SDL's own device
  list. That was documented at the time as "intentional and FNA-faithful" by analogy with FNA's note
  that *Windows* only notices a touch screen once it is touched (`SDL3_FNAPlatform.cs:972`) — but FNA's
  own `GetTouchCapabilities()` still calls `SDL_GetTouchDevices()` unconditionally on every platform, so
  a real enumerable-but-untouched device on any non-Windows platform was reported disconnected, which
  was not actually FNA-faithful. The fix makes SDL enumeration the primary source; `touchDeviceExists_`
  and `HasAnyTouch()` remain as fallbacks specifically for the Windows-style late-enumeration case.
  Still fully non-mutating (none of the three checks call `GetTouchState()`). Pinned by
  `GetCapabilitiesIsDisconnectedBeforeAnyTouch`, `GetCapabilitiesIsConnectedOnceTouchDeviceExists`,
  `GetCapabilitiesIsConnectedViaInputManagerFallbackWhenFlagUnset`, and the
  `TouchCapabilitiesEnumerationTest` fixture (fake-backend enumeration, empty-enumeration-with-sticky-
  flag, empty-enumeration-with-live-touch, and non-mutation cases).
- **Touch collection ordering (DEC-20, P5-012):** FNA's `TouchPanel.GetState()` iterates its fixed
  `touches[0..MAX_TOUCHES]` array (`TouchPanel.cs:97`), so its collection order is **SDL finger-array slot
  order**. CNA's event-driven fallback (`InputManager::GetTouchState`) instead orders by **ascending touch
  id** (`std::sort` of the id set). Both are fully deterministic; because CNA touch ids are a compact
  sequential appearance-order counter (see above) with lowest-free reuse, ascending-id order tracks
  appearance/slot order the same way FNA's does. Order is opaque to games (they index by finger id, not
  position). Pinned by `TouchInputTest.GetStateHandlesMultipleTouchIdsAndKeepsDeterministicOrder` and
  `GetStateOrdersMultipleTouchesByAscendingIdRegardlessOfInsertionOrder`.
- `TouchPanel::Update()` copies current→previous **before** the gesture update; FNA does gesture update
  first (`TouchPanel.cs:219`). **Confirmed inert (DEC-13, 2026-07-05):** `GestureDetector::OnUpdate()`
  operates only on the gesture detector's own state and never reads or writes `touches_`/`previousTouches_`,
  so the two statements touch disjoint state and the ordering is unobservable. Pinned by
  `TouchEdgeCaseTest.UpdatePropagatesTouchesToPreviousForSlotPathContinuity`.
- `TryGetPreviousLocation` now writes the out-param on **every** path (DEC-12, fixed 2026-07-05): it
  assigns `TouchLocation(Id, prevState, prevPosition)` and returns `prevState != Invalid`, matching FNA
  exactly (on the `false` path the out-param is the Invalid previous location, not left untouched).
- **`GetState()`/`GetTouchState()` frame-accurate read (INP-AUD-001, fixed 2026-07-16):** FNA's
  `TouchPanel.GetState()` is a pure collection read; its frame advance (`SetFinger`-equivalent
  polling) happens once per frame in FNA's own `Update()`, not inside the getter
  (`TouchPanel.cs:94-105, 224-228`). CNA's event-driven `InputManager::GetTouchState()` previously
  advanced `Pressed`→`Moved` promotion, `Released` retirement, and previous-location tracking
  **inline on every call**, so the reported state depended on how many times application code
  called `GetState()` per frame rather than on the frame boundary (two reads in one frame could
  observe `Pressed` then `Moved`; zero reads in a frame silently skipped a promotion/retirement).
  Fixed by splitting the operation: `GetTouchState()` is now a pure snapshot read, and a new
  `InputManager::AdvanceTouchFrame()` performs the previous-state promotion/release retirement
  exactly once per frame, called from `TouchPanel::Update()` — itself driven once per
  `Game::Update()` tick via `FrameworkDispatcher::Update()`. Pinned by
  `GetTouchStateIsPureAndRepeatedReadsWithinAFrameAreIdentical`,
  `AdvanceTouchFrameWorksEvenWithoutAnIntermediateRead`, and
  `ReleasedTouchIsVisibleForExactlyOnePostAdvanceReadRegardlessOfPriorReads`
  (`tests/CNA/Internal/Input/TouchEdgeCaseTests.cpp`).

## Gestures

`GestureDetector` reproduces FNA's tap / double-tap / hold / drag / flick / pinch state machine.
Covered by `GestureDetectorTests` and the end-to-end `SdlInputBridgeTouchGestureTests` (including the
new `FINGER_CANCELED` release path). Broader parameterized regression coverage across every gesture
type + interruption is partial (task 906).

**Threshold constants verified byte-identical to FNA (P6-026/027/028, 2026-07-17):** independently
re-derived from `GestureDetector.cs` rather than trusting prior claims —
`MOVE_THRESHOLD`=35px (`GestureDetector.cpp:34`), `MIN_FLICK_VELOCITY`=100.0f (`:35`), the double-tap
timing window=300ms (`:182`, `TimeSpan.FromMilliseconds(300)` in FNA), the hold threshold=1 second
(`:230`/`:419`, `TimeSpan.FromSeconds(1)` in FNA), and the flick-velocity exponential-smoothing formula
`velocity += (instVelocity - velocity) * 0.45f` where `instVelocity = delta / (0.001f + dt)`
(`GestureDetector.cpp:406-409`, byte-identical to `GestureDetector.cs:504-507`). None of these
thresholds scale with `TouchPanel.DisplayWidth`/`DisplayHeight` in either engine — they are fixed pixel/
time constants (P6-033: confirmed NOT display-size-dependent, matching FNA).

**Intentional / documented deviation — gesture auto-timestamp units (P6-012, found 2026-07-17):**
FNA's `GestureDetector.GetGestureTimestamp()` (`GestureDetector.cs:546-552`) is
`TimeSpan.FromTicks(Environment.TickCount)` — `Environment.TickCount` is a **millisecond** counter, but
`TimeSpan.FromTicks` expects **100ns ticks**, so FNA's own formula has a ~10000x unit mismatch versus
its own doc comment ("XNA calculates gesture timestamps from how long the device has been turned on").
CNA's `GetGestureTimestamp()` (`GestureDetector.cpp:67-74`) instead converts the millisecond count to
ticks correctly (`ms * TimeSpan::TicksPerMillisecond`), producing a dimensionally accurate "time since
epoch" `TimeSpan`. This is a deliberate, accepted deviation, not a bug: `GestureSample.Timestamp` has no
defined absolute reference point in either engine (it is not wall-clock time, and no game-facing
contract depends on its exact scale), only relative ordering/deltas between gesture events matter in
practice, and both formulas remain monotonically increasing with real elapsed time. Replicating FNA's
literal unit-mismatch here would trade a real correctness property for a match against what reads as an
upstream implementation slip, with no compatibility benefit since no observable game behavior depends on
the absolute value. Not previously documented; added here as part of the P6 audit.

**`GestureSample` equality/`ToString` (P6-039, confirmed 2026-07-17):** neither FNA's
`GestureSample.cs` nor CNA's `GestureSample.hpp` defines `Equals`/`GetHashCode`/`ToString`/`operator==`
— it is a bare value-carrier struct in both engines (no `ValueType`-default override needed, unlike
`MouseState`/`GamePadState`/`KeyboardState`). Nothing to test; confirmed absent by design in both.

**Gesture queue has no overflow/eviction policy (P6-035, confirmed 2026-07-17):** FNA's
`gestures` is a plain `Queue<GestureSample>` (`TouchPanel.cs:80`) and CNA's `gestures_` is a plain
`std::queue<GestureSample>` (`TouchPanel.hpp:217`) — both grow unbounded if a game never calls
`ReadGesture()`. This is accepted upstream XNA/FNA behavior (a "the game is expected to drain its
queue" API contract), not a CNA-specific gap to fix.

## TextInputEXT / TextEditing

`TextInputEXT` (unlike most `EXT`-suffixed CNA types) is not a CNA invention — FNA itself already
ships a `Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Input.TextInputEXT` static class (`FNA/src/Input/TextInputEXT.cs`)
as its own beyond-XNA-4.0 extension, so it is ported as a strict FNA-parity type in the
`Microsoft::Xna` namespace, not tagged `NOXNA` itself. FNA's baseline surface is exactly:
`TextInput`/`TextEditing` events, `WindowHandle` property, `IsTextInputActive()`,
`IsScreenKeyboardShown()`/`IsScreenKeyboardShown(window)`, `StartTextInput()`, `StopTextInput()`,
`SetInputRectangle()` — every one of these is a faithful 1:1 port (P2-030). CNA layers three
`NOXNA`-tagged members with no FNA analog on top of that baseline: `TextEditingCandidatesEXT` (IME
candidate-list event; FNA's `TextInputEXT` has no candidates support at all),
`StartTextInputWithTypeEXT(TextInputTypeEXT)` and the `CNA::Input::TextInputTypeEXT` enum itself
(a 9-value mobile/on-screen-keyboard hint mirroring SDL3's `SDL_TextInputType` one-to-one — verified
against `SDL_keyboard.h`, P2-051). Those three are the only genuine extension surface; everything
else in this section is FNA-required behavior, not CNA scope creep.

| Aspect | Status |
|---|---|
| `StartTextInput`/`StopTextInput`/`SetInputRectangle`/active-window | **Faithful ports** (+ null-window guards). |
| UTF-8 → UTF-16 decode (BMP + astral surrogate pairs) | **Matches FNA** (`Encoding.UTF8.GetChars` equivalent). Exhaustively tested. |
| `TextInput` code-unit type | `charcs`/UTF-16 code unit, matching FNA's `Action<char>` (Phase I9 task 806). |
| Control-char synthesis (Home/End/Back/Tab/Enter/Delete/Ctrl+V) | **Matches FNA exactly**: `(char)2/3/8/9/13/127/22` via the same `TextInputBindings`/`TextInputCharacters` table as `FNAPlatform.cs:261-278` (P2-039..045). |

**Intentional / documented deviations:**
- **Multicast callbacks (DEC-06, fixed 2026-07-05):** `TextInput`/`TextEditing` are now
  `System::MulticastAction<...>` matching FNA's `event Action<...>` — `+=` adds subscribers, `=` replaces,
  `= nullptr` clears. (Were single `std::function`s; the second-subscriber-lost gap is closed.)
- **`TextEditing` string is UTF-8** (`std::string`) vs FNA's decoded UTF-16 string; `start`/`length`
  index bytes vs UTF-16 units. Documented.
- **Malformed UTF-8 emits U+FFFD (DEC-08, fixed 2026-07-05):** `decode_utf8_to_utf16` now substitutes
  U+FFFD for an invalid lead byte, an ill-formed sequence (one per maximal subpart, resyncing to the next
  valid text), an overlong encoding, a UTF-16 surrogate code point, or an out-of-range code point —
  matching FNA's `Encoding.UTF8` replacement fallback. (Was silently skipped; unreachable via SDL, which
  guarantees well-formed UTF-8, but now FNA-faithful.)
- Empty composition emits `("", 0, 0)` vs FNA's `(null, 0, 0)` (`std::string` cannot be null).

## SDL bridge robustness

- `ProcessEvent` switches over all supported event types with a safe `default: break;` — unknown
  events are ignored (task 949). Unmapped keys/buttons/axes are dropped without side effects.
- Window handles are derived defensively (`SDL_GetWindowFromID` → `SDL_GetMouseFocus()` fallback);
  `nullptr` windows are handled everywhere (task 950).
- **Focus loss (task 951 / DEC-15) — DECISION: match FNA, no clear (accepted 2026-07-05).** On
  `SDL_EVENT_WINDOW_FOCUS_LOST` neither FNA nor CNA clears accumulated input state. FNA is **also
  event-driven and accumulating** — its `Keyboard.keys` list is mutated by KEY_DOWN/KEY_UP
  (`SDL3_FNAPlatform.cs:905-940`), and on focus loss it *only* sets `game.IsActive = false`
  (`SDL3_FNAPlatform.cs:1026-1035`); it never clears keys. So FNA has the **identical** stuck-key edge
  case (a held key whose up-event is delivered to another window) — not merely the same behavior with a
  different consequence. CNA therefore matches FNA in both behavior and consequence, which is the correct
  call under the FNA-fidelity principle. A beyond-FNA `ClearTransientState()` on focus loss was considered
  and **rejected** (it would silently diverge from the reference); the XNA-standard mitigation is for the
  game to gate input on `Game.IsActive`. Pinned by
  `SdlInputBridgeKeyboardTest.WindowFocusLostDoesNotClearHeldKeysMatchingFna`.
- **`Game.IsActive` on desktop focus change (INP-AUD-002, fixed 2026-07-16):** the "gate on
  `Game.IsActive`" mitigation described just above only works if `IsActive` is actually correct.
  Until this fix, `Game::PollEvents()` handled the mobile-style
  `SDL_EVENT_WILL_ENTER_BACKGROUND`/`SDL_EVENT_DID_ENTER_FOREGROUND` pair but had no case for the
  desktop `SDL_EVENT_WINDOW_FOCUS_LOST`/`SDL_EVENT_WINDOW_FOCUS_GAINED` pair, so an ordinary desktop
  Alt-Tab left `Game::IsActive` `true` forever and never raised `Activated`/`Deactivated`. Both
  events now route through `setIsActiveProperty`, matching FNA
  (`SDL3_FNAPlatform.cs:1006-1037`). **Known scope gap (intentional, not part of this fix):** FNA's
  handler for these two events also toggles the X11 "fullscreen desktop" window flag and
  enables/disables the SDL screensaver; CNA does not replicate either. Neither affects input
  semantics (the subject of this audit); revisit only if X11 fullscreen-on-Alt-Tab behavior or
  screensaver suppression is reported as a real-world gap.
- **Coordinate consistency (INPUT-TOUCH-024, was task 952 — verified):** both touch paths target the same
  **logical (virtual back-buffer) coordinate space.** `GraphicsDevice` sets `TouchPanel::DisplayWidth/Height`
  to `virtualWidth/Height`. The **gesture** path scales the normalized SDL coord linearly by
  `DisplayWidth/Height` (`round(x·W, y·H)` in `TouchPanel::INTERNAL_onTouchEvent`) — identical to FNA, which
  also scales normalized touch by the back-buffer size. The **touch-state** path (`to_touch_pixel_position`
  → `to_logical_position`) maps into that same logical space. For a **uniform** presentation (no letterbox
  bars — e.g. EasyGL's `FixedHeightDynamicWidth` default, or any matched-aspect `SDL_Renderer`) the two
  coincide exactly; pinned by `GestureAndTouchStateShareTheLogicalCoordinateBasis` (gesturePos ÷ metric ==
  the normalized state position). **Known edge nuance:** under a true letterbox (logical aspect ≠ window
  aspect, centering bars) the gesture path stays linear (FNA-matching) while the touch-state path is
  letterbox-aware, so the two can differ *within the bar regions* — where a touch does not land on game
  content anyway. This is accepted (gesture side matches FNA; the divergence is confined to the bars).
  `displayOrientation_` is stored but not applied to coordinates (matches FNA).

## Definition of Done for Input (task 958)

Input is "done" when **all** of these hold — not before:

1. Full configure succeeds in a **complete** checkout (submodules + sibling repos present).
2. All input unit tests pass.
3. Fake-SDL / gamepad tests pass (**satisfied — Phase I15**: 20 device-level tests via the injectable
   `ISdlGamepadBackend`). Real-hardware *actuation* remains manual-only (see above).
4. Docs updated (this file + `input-build-and-test.md`).
5. Intentional FNA deviations listed (this file).
6. No stale `Status: PARTIAL` comments unless still true.

Coverage is **not** claimed as "100% FNA fidelity". Phase I15 added the fake SDL gamepad layer, so
the gamepad SDL-bound *translation/bookkeeping* paths are now headless-tested (not just audited); what
remains is real-hardware *actuation*, which is manual-only. See `plan_input.md` for the per-task status.

## Extension APIs (FNAEXT / NOXNA) — INP-0214

Beyond the strict XNA 4.0 surface, CNA exposes the FNA/MonoGame extensions and CNA conveniences below.
See the tier glossary in `input-public-api-frozen.md`.

- **`TextInputEXT`** (FNAEXT, whole class NOXNA) — portable text input/IME that XNA 4.0 lacked:
  `StartTextInput`/`StopTextInput`, the `TextInput` (per UTF-16 code unit) and `TextEditing` (IME
  composition) multicast events, `SetInputRectangle`, `IsTextInputActive`, `IsScreenKeyboardShown`,
  `WindowHandle`. Backed by SDL text-input; UTF-8→UTF-16 decode + control-char/Ctrl+V synthesis.
- **`MouseCursor`** (NOXNA, whole class) — MonoGame-style custom cursors: stock cursors, `FromTexture2D`,
  ownership/disposal. Cursor creation needs `SDL_INIT_VIDEO` (graceful null otherwise).
- **Relative mouse mode** (`Mouse::…IsRelativeMouseModeEXT`) — FPS-style pointer lock + relative-delta
  accumulation; not a stock XNA concept.
- **Scancode mode** (`Keyboard::GetKeyFromScancodeEXT` + `FNA_KEYBOARD_USE_SCANCODES`) — layout-independent
  physical-key mapping, matching FNA.
- **GamePad EXT** — `GetGUIDEXT` (device GUID), `SetLightBarEXT` (PS4/5 LED), `SetTriggerVibrationEXT`
  (adaptive-trigger haptics), `GetGyroEXT`/`GetAccelerometerEXT` (motion sensors); plus the
  `GamePadCapabilities` `Has…EXT` flags. All FNA extensions, capability-gated.
- **`Mouse::ClickedEXT`** — FNA's click callback (`MulticastAction<int>`, DEC-06).
- **`GestureSample::FingerId(2)EXT`** — per-gesture finger ids (NOXNA convenience).

## Convention: verified fact vs intended behavior (INP-0216)

Throughout the input docs, a claim is either a **✅ verified fact** (backed by a green test or a mechanical
tool — the default for statements citing a `…Test`, the parity/coverage generators, or a compile guard) or
a **🎯 intended behavior** (implemented and FNA-faithful in code but **not** machine-verified here — e.g.
real-hardware actuation, live IME, native-Wayland cursor landing). Hardware/human-gated items are recorded
as 🎯/"not verified" in `input-manual-verification-results.md`, never asserted as ✅. Do not upgrade a 🎯 to
✅ without a green test or a dated manual entry.
