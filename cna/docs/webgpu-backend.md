# WebGPU graphics backend

## Status

The WebGPU backend was activated by the project owner on **2026-07-12** and is currently an
**experimental fifth CNA graphics backend**. Select it with:

```bash
cmake -S . -B cmake-build-webgpu \
  -DCNA_GRAPHICS_BACKEND=WEBGPU \
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
cmake --build cmake-build-webgpu -j
```

CNA pins the native implementation to **wgpu-native v29.0.1.1**. By default CMake downloads the
official prebuilt package for a supported host. For offline or reproducible builds, extract the
official package yourself and configure:

```bash
cmake -S . -B cmake-build-webgpu \
  -DCNA_GRAPHICS_BACKEND=WEBGPU \
  -DCNA_WEBGPU_ROOT=/absolute/path/to/extracted/wgpu-native \
  -DCNA_WEBGPU_AUTO_DOWNLOAD=OFF
```

The extracted root must contain `include/webgpu.h` (or `include/webgpu/webgpu.h`) and a
`libwgpu_native` library below `lib/`. The existing CNA requirements still apply: the SDL3,
SDL3_image and SDL3_mixer submodules, plus the sibling `../sharp-runtime` checkout, must be
present.

For the verified Linux x86_64 layout, an extracted package may be placed at
`vendor/wgpu-native/` with `include/webgpu/webgpu.h` and `lib/libwgpu_native.so`. The following
clean offline sequence builds a self-contained demo directory:

```bash
cmake -S . -B /tmp/cna-webgpu-128 \
  -DCNA_GRAPHICS_BACKEND=WEBGPU \
  -DCNA_WEBGPU_ROOT="$PWD/vendor/wgpu-native" \
  -DCNA_WEBGPU_AUTO_DOWNLOAD=OFF \
  -DCNA_BUILD_TESTS=OFF \
  -DCNA_BUILD_EXAMPLES=ON \
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
cmake --build /tmp/cna-webgpu-128 --target cna_demo_2d -j1
cd /tmp/cna-webgpu-128
readelf -d ./cna_demo_2d | grep -E 'NEEDED.*wgpu|RUNPATH'
ldd ./cna_demo_2d | grep libwgpu_native.so
timeout 60s ./cna_demo_2d --smoke 120
```

The WebGPU CMake target links wgpu-native by filename despite the package library lacking an ELF
SONAME, copies the runtime beside `cna_demo_2d`, and gives the executable a `$ORIGIN` runtime path.
This enables the executable to use its sibling `libwgpu_native.so` rather than requiring the
original package location at runtime.

## Automated native smoke test

With `CNA_BUILD_TESTS=ON`, the WebGPU configuration registers `WebGPU_Native2D_Smoke` with CTest:

```bash
ctest --test-dir /tmp/cna-webgpu-128 -R '^WebGPU_Native2D_Smoke$' --output-on-failure
```

The test runs `cna_demo_2d --smoke 120` when the host exposes Wayland or X11. It passed in 2.30
seconds on the verified desktop. When neither `WAYLAND_DISPLAY` nor `DISPLAY` is available, the
wrapper reports a clear skipped result rather than treating the lack of a desktop GPU/display as a
backend failure.

CNA enables compiler caching automatically when `ccache` is installed. The setting is applied
before the sibling `sharp-runtime` project is added, so both CNA and `sharp-runtime` objects are
reused across compatible build directories. Disable it with `-DCNA_USE_CCACHE=OFF`; existing custom
compiler launchers are never overwritten. Even without `ccache`, reusing the same CMake build
directory keeps the normal incremental object cache and avoids rebuilding unchanged
`sharp-runtime` sources.

## Verified native smoke gate

`WEBGPU-125` was verified on Linux desktop on 2026-07-12 with the explicit offline package:

```bash
cmake -S . -B /tmp/cna-webgpu-125 \
  -DCNA_GRAPHICS_BACKEND=WEBGPU \
  -DCNA_WEBGPU_ROOT="$PWD/vendor/wgpu-native" \
  -DCNA_WEBGPU_AUTO_DOWNLOAD=OFF \
  -DCNA_BUILD_TESTS=OFF \
  -DCNA_BUILD_EXAMPLES=ON \
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
cmake --build /tmp/cna-webgpu-125 --target cna_demo_2d -j1
cd /tmp/cna-webgpu-125
timeout 60s ./cna_demo_2d --smoke 120
```

The executable cleared and presented 120 frames, then exited with status 0 in 2.10 seconds. No
uncaptured WebGPU error, device-loss report or dynamic-loader failure was emitted. This verifies
the native initialization, frame submission, present and normal teardown path only; it is not a
pixel-correctness result for SpriteBatch or Texture2D.

## SpriteBatch validation scene

`cna_demo_2d` provides the deterministic coverage scene used to verify `WEBGPU-126`:

```bash
cd /tmp/cna-webgpu-125
./cna_demo_2d --webgpu-2d-validation --smoke 120
```

It uploads `player.png` and displays source rectangles, tint/alpha blending, rotation, horizontal
and vertical flips, linear and point filtering, and clamp/wrap/mirror address modes. The last
three use UVs outside the texture's `[0, 1]` range so their visual results differ. During the run,
the native window resizes from 800×600 to 960×540 and back, exercising logical presentation and
surface reconfiguration. The command completes without WebGPU errors; a manual desktop screenshot
review on 2026-07-12 confirmed the expected crop, tint/alpha, rotation, flips and sampler results.

## Lifecycle recovery

`WEBGPU-127` replaced the original unbounded adapter/device callback waits with
`wgpuInstanceProcessEvents` polling and a 10-second timeout. This avoids the pinned v29 package's
unimplemented `wgpuInstanceWaitAny` path, which aborts rather than waiting. A minimized or
zero-size window now unconfigures the surface and releases the depth attachment; restoring it
causes the normal surface configuration path to rebuild them. The 180-frame validation command
above exercised resize, minimize, restore and normal teardown with exit status 0 and no WebGPU
error.

## Independent application integration and native 2D baseline

`WEBGPU-130` integrated `../mobile-eggbert` (`WindowsPhoneSpeedyBlupi`, an independently-developed
XNA-style game, not a CNA example) as a second, real-world consumer of this backend, verified on
Linux desktop 2026-07-12:

```bash
cd ../mobile-eggbert
cmake -B cmake-build-debug \
  -DCNA_GRAPHICS_BACKEND=WEBGPU \
  -DCNA_WEBGPU_ROOT=/absolute/path/to/cna_graphics/vendor/wgpu-native \
  -DCNA_WEBGPU_AUTO_DOWNLOAD=OFF
cmake --build cmake-build-debug --target WindowsPhoneSpeedyBlupi -j
cd cmake-build-debug
DISPLAY=:0 ./WindowsPhoneSpeedyBlupi
```

The build links `cna_backend_graphics_webgpu` and copies `libwgpu_native.so` beside the executable
with `$ORIGIN` first in `RUNPATH`, the same deployment shape `WEBGPU-128` verified for `cna_demo_2d`.
On a real desktop session it reached its main menu automatically (~5 seconds after launch) with
pixel-correct `SpriteBatch` rendering (title text, an animated character, a player-select panel, a
Setup icon and a Play button), and a simulated click on the Play button correctly triggered its
mission-start sequence — an animated cutscene with a filling progress bar and a cross-fade
transition, rendered correctly frame-by-frame with no WebGPU validation errors. This exercises real
multi-sprite, multi-frame animation and alpha-blended fade compositing beyond the synthetic
validation scene above, independently confirming the SpriteBatch pipeline, Texture2D upload and
resize/present paths against a second, unrelated codebase.

`WEBGPU-131` closes the native 2D baseline on this evidence: `WEBGPU-124`–`WEBGPU-130` are all
verified. 3D effects, render targets and MRT remain open (Phase 57 onward in `plan_webgpu.md`).

## GPU readback and a real translucency fix (2026-07-12)

`WebGPUGraphicsBackend::ReadBackbuffer()`/`GraphicsDevice.GetBackBufferData()` are implemented
(`WEBGPU-91`/`55`): a row-aligned staging buffer, `wgpuCommandEncoderCopyTextureToBuffer` inside
the frame's own command encoder, `wgpuBufferMapAsync` polling. Because a naive implementation could
only ever observe the *previous* frame's content on a swapchain-backed target, `Present()` was
refactored into a shared `EnsureFrameRendered()` so `GetBackBufferData()` can force an on-demand
render of whatever's queued so far in the current `Draw()` call — matching Vulkan/Bgfx's own
on-demand-submit readback semantics. New `WebGPU_Clear_Readback` CTest.

Writing that test's alpha case then found and fixed a real, previously-unknown bug (`WEBGPU-132`):
the `SpriteBatch` pipeline's blend factors didn't match its own shader's non-premultiplied output,
so any tint/texture alpha strictly between 0 and 255 was silently ignored for colour — a
translucent sprite rendered fully opaque. Invisible to `WEBGPU-126`'s manual screenshot review;
caught only by a pixel assertion. Fixed by matching Vulkan's own blend-factor pairing.

## First 3D draw path (2026-07-12)

`DrawColoredPrimitives()`/`DrawIndexedColoredPrimitives()` (a `VertexPositionColor`, stride-16,
unlit/untextured 3D draw — the path `GraphicsDevice.DrawUserPrimitives()`/
`DrawUserIndexedPrimitives()` already route to directly) are implemented: a 128-float uniform
buffer matching `VulkanGraphicsBackend::FillExtPushConst()`'s layout byte-for-byte, a `colored3d.wgsl`
shader, and a depth-aware pipeline cache. New `WebGPU_Colored3D` CTest proves genuine depth-buffer
comparison (not "last draw wins"): a near and a far full-screen quad resolve to the near one
regardless of draw order. Since `IGraphicsBackend::DrawPrimitivesEx()`'s own default implementation
falls back to `DrawColoredPrimitives()`, simple (unlit, untextured) `BasicEffect`/`Model.Draw()`
calls now render via that fallback instead of throwing, though real lighting/texture/fog dispatch
(`WEBGPU-66`) is still open. Writing this test's own depth-order check also found and fixed a
separate, real gap: `WebGPUGraphicsBackend::ApplyDepthStencilState()` was entirely unimplemented
(silently inherited the interface's no-op default), so `GraphicsDevice.DepthStencilState` — the
real XNA API surface almost every game/effect uses — had zero effect on this backend; only the
older `SetDepthTestEnabled()`/`SetDepthWriteEnabled()` convenience methods worked. Now implements
the depth portion (stencil ops remain open, `WEBGPU-83`).

## PbrEffect (unskinned metallic-roughness BRDF)

`pbr3d.wgsl` / `GetOrCreatePipelinePbr3D()` implement `PbrEffect`'s real glTF 2.0
metallic-roughness BRDF (GGX distribution + Smith-Schlick-GGX visibility + Schlick Fresnel),
ported from `EasyGLGraphicsBackend::EnsurePbrProgram()`'s GLSL shader, for stride-48
(`VertexPositionNormalTangentTexture`) draws. Base color, normal, metallic-roughness, emissive
and occlusion maps are all supported, each falling back to a 1x1 default texture (flat normal /
white, matching the EasyGL backend's own "map absent" convention) when `PbrEffect` leaves that
map unbound. Group 0 reuses the existing `Uniforms`/`LitLightParams` UBO shapes byte-for-byte
(populated by the already-existing `FillExtUniforms()`/`FillLitLightUniforms()` helpers) plus one
new small `PbrFactors` UBO for `MetallicFactor`/`RoughnessFactor`; group 1 is a new 5-texture +
1-sampler bind group. New `WebGPU_Pbr3D` CTest hand-derives the exact GGX/Fresnel formula for a
fixed light/view/normal geometry and independently confirms the observed pixel values are within
a few 8-bit units of the analytic prediction (after accounting for the sRGB swapchain's gamma
encoding), plus qualitative ambient/facing/back-facing/normal-map/metallic-vs-dielectric checks.

**Scope**: unskinned only, at the time this shader was added. Fog and alpha-test are deliberately
not wired into `pbr3d.wgsl`: every other WebGPU 3D shader already defers fog identically, and
`PbrEffect::FillGpuDrawParams()` never sets `GpuDrawParams::alphaTest` away from its always-pass
default, so that branch would be permanently dead code. `SkinnedPbrEffect` (stride 68) is now
implemented separately — see "SkinnedEffect and SkinnedPbrEffect (bone-palette skinning)" below.

## SkinnedEffect and SkinnedPbrEffect (bone-palette skinning)

`skinned3d.wgsl`'s four shader-module variants (per-pixel-lit/per-vertex-lit ×
without/with vertex colour) plus `skinned_pbr3d.wgsl` close this backend's former "no skinning
shader at all" gap, ported line-for-line from
`EasyGLGraphicsBackend::EnsureSkinnedProgram()`/`EnsureSkinnedVertexLitProgram()`/
`EnsurePbrSkinnedProgram()`. Bone-palette skinning (up to 72 bones, a new `SkinningParams` UBO —
a `WeightsPerVertex` header plus `array<mat4x4f, 72>`) matches Task 895's convention: only the
first `WeightsPerVertex` (1, 2, or 4) weight/index pairs are summed. Because a WebGPU pipeline must
supply every vertex-shader-referenced attribute location from its own vertex buffer layout (unlike
`EasyGLGraphicsBackend::ApplyLayout`'s own "leave attribute 5 unbound" precedent for stride 52),
the stride-52 (`VertexPositionNormalTextureSkinned`) and stride-56 (with a trailing per-vertex
`Color`, CNB-67) cases each get their own shader module pair, mirroring this backend's existing
`texturedShader_`/`coloredTexturedShader_` precedent for the analogous stride-20/24 split; the
vertex-colour gate multiplies the *final* combined diffuse+specular output, applied after the
specular add (matching the EasyGL reference's own fix for that exact ordering trap).
`skinned_pbr3d.wgsl` (stride 68, `VertexPositionNormalTangentTextureSkinned`) reuses the same
bone-palette vertex transform (extended to also skin Tangent) feeding `pbr3d.wgsl`'s own BRDF
fragment stage unchanged, and reuses `pbrBindGroupLayout1_` (the 5-texture group) unchanged for its
own group 1. No vertex colour on the PBR+skinning combo (matches the EasyGL reference, which has
none either) and no fog/alpha-test on any of the new shaders (same deliberate deferral as every
other WebGPU 3D shader — `SkinnedEffect`/`SkinnedPbrEffect` never set `GpuDrawParams::alphaTest`
away from its always-pass default).

New `WebGPU_Skinned3D` (9 checks) and `WebGPU_SkinnedPbr3D` (5 checks) CTests both pass 100%: a
hand-derived NDC-shift check (two bones, one identity and one a translation, summed under a
uniform-scale-then-perspective-divide argument worked out algebraically, not measured) proves both
the bone-palette translation genuinely reaches the vertex shader *and* that `WeightsPerVertex`
correctly gates which bones contribute; ambient/facing/back-facing checks prove real lighting
reaches both shader families; a `VertexColorEnabled` check (pure black per-vertex colour, mirroring
`examples/easygl_skinnedeffect_vertexcolor_test.cpp`'s own convention) proves the stride-56 colour
path; and a `PreferPerPixelLighting` check (Gouraud-averaged vs fresh-per-fragment specular at a
triangle seam) proves the vertex-lit/pixel-lit dispatch selects two genuinely different shaders.

## RenderTarget2D (single-target, 2026-07-18)

`WebGPURenderTargetBackend` (`WEBGPU-53`/`54`) is this backend's first real off-screen render
target: its own colour texture, always created in the swapchain's own chosen format
(`surfaceFormat_`) rather than `Texture2D`'s `RGBA8Unorm` so every existing
`GetOrCreatePipeline*3D()` (each hardcodes `target.format = surfaceFormat_` at pipeline-creation
time) renders into it unchanged, with zero new pipeline-cache dimensions; and its own combined
depth+stencil texture, always `Depth24PlusStencil8` regardless of the requested `DepthFormat`
(mirroring `VulkanGraphicsBackend`'s own "always allocates a combined depth+stencil buffer using
its device-wide format regardless of the exact value requested" simplification), because every
pipeline here unconditionally declares a depth-stencil state.

The trickier part was this backend's existing single-deferred-render-pass-per-frame architecture:
every queued `Clear()`/3D-draw/`SpriteBatch` command normally collapses into one render pass
against the swapchain, lazily, the first time something actually needs the frame to be real
(`EnsureFrameRendered()`). `SetRenderTarget2D()` now eagerly flushes whatever was queued for the
OUTGOING target the instant the target actually changes (closing out that render pass immediately
via the new `RenderPendingDrawsToRenderTarget()`, and starting fresh accumulation for the new
target) rather than tagging every one of this backend's ~10 `Queue*Draw()` families with a target
and replaying them grouped-by-target at final-flush time, closer to `VulkanGraphicsBackend`'s own
deferred-recording model — the smaller change for a backend with no pre-existing per-draw
deferred/replay infrastructure to extend.

A `RenderTarget2D` sampled back as an ordinary texture (`SpriteBatch`/`BasicEffect.Texture`) needed
one more fix: every `Queue*Draw()` previously resolved its bound texture with an *unchecked*
`static_cast<const WebGPUTextureBackend*>`, safe only because `WebGPUTextureBackend` used to be the
only `ITextureBackend`-implementing class this backend had. `WebGPURenderTargetBackend` is a
second, unrelated one, so this became a real hazard the first time a `GpuDrawParams::textureN`
actually pointed at one — fixed by introducing `IWebGPUSamplable` (mirroring
`VulkanGraphicsBackend`'s own `IVulkanSamplable`) and a `dynamic_cast`-based `ResolveSamplable()`
helper everywhere a texture pointer is stored, so an incompatible type now safely resolves to
"unbound" instead of undefined behaviour.

Mip-chain regeneration is deliberately deferred, not silently under-delivered:
`CreateRenderTarget2D()` throws a clear error for `mipMap=true`. MSAA (`WEBGPU-58`) is implemented
and verified end-to-end as of 2026-07-18: the backend-global `sampleCount_`,
`ApplyMultiSampleCount()`'s empirically-probed clamped-return-value contract, and
`WebGPURenderTargetBackend`'s unconditional mirroring of that global sample count all work, and a
genuine multisample-resolved render now works through the real `GraphicsDevice`/`BasicEffect` draw
path for both the backbuffer and a `RenderTarget2D` (`WebGPU_Msaa`, 6/6). The initial investigation
found the MSAA infrastructure itself was already correct; the reported failures (Checks B/D-2/E)
turned out to be a test-authoring defect in `examples/webgpu_msaa_test.cpp` — its diagonal triangle
relied on `BasicEffect`'s default `RasterizerState` (`CullCounterClockwiseFace`) without the
`RasterizerState::CullNone` override every other WebGPU 3D test in this suite sets, and the
triangle's winding is a genuine XNA back face under this backend's (independently correct)
`ToWGPUCullMode()` mapping, so it was being legitimately backface-culled regardless of MSAA. See
`WEBGPU-58`'s `plan_webgpu.md` row for the full investigation. `WebGPU_RenderTarget2D` (8 checks) verifies a Clear-only round
trip and a real `BasicEffect` draw round trip via `GetData()`, a depth+stencil-tested target (a
farther red quad loses to a nearer green one, with a genuine `ClearOptions::Stencil` clear — this
also closed `WEBGPU-8`/`9`'s previously-unexercised stencil-attachment gap), sampling all 3 targets
back through `SpriteBatch`, and — the architecture's critical proof — that a render-target-targeted
`Clear()` sandwiched between two backbuffer `Clear()`/readback calls does not leak into the
backbuffer's own render pass.

## EnvironmentMapEffect and real instancing (2026-07-18)

`env_map3d.wgsl` / `GetOrCreatePipelineEnvMap3D()` (`WEBGPU-25`/`36`/`74`) close this backend's
former "no cube-map shader at all" gap, ported from `VulkanGraphicsBackend`'s
`env_map3d.{vert,frag}.glsl` (cross-checked against `EasyGLGraphicsBackend::
EnsureEnvMapped3DProgram()`'s identical GLSL formula before porting). Stride 32
(`VertexPositionNormalTexture`, the same layout as `lit_textured3d.wgsl`). Group 0 binding 0 is a
new `Transform` UBO (mvp+world — WebGPU has no push constants); binding 1 is `EnvMapParams` (eye
position, diffuse, emissive+amount, all 3 directional lights, envMapSpecular+Fresnel, fog, and a
CPU-precomputed 3×3 normal matrix, since WGSL has no `inverse()`). Group 1 is a new 3-binding shape
(sampler + `texture_2d` + `texture_cube`), mirroring `dualTextureBindGroupLayout_`'s own 3-binding
shape with the second `texture_2d` swapped for a `texture_cube`. Getting a cube map to sample at all
required a new, minimal `WebGPUTextureCubeBackend` (`WEBGPU-56`/`113`) — this backend previously had
no `TextureCube` support whatsoever; it is deliberately NOT full parity (no `GetData()`, no
`RenderTargetCube`, mip regeneration untested beyond pre-allocating empty levels). `WebGPU_EnvMap3D`
(4/4): hand-derived geometry (`View`=`World`=Identity, quad at z=0.5, `Normal`=(0,0,-1)) makes the
reflection vector land exactly on `CubeMapFace::NegativeZ` — proven by painting each of the 6 faces
a distinct solid colour and asserting the correct one appears (not just "some colour"); a
differential Fresnel check (identical scene, only `FresnelFactor` differs) proves the Fresnel term
genuinely gates the blend rather than being present-but-inert; `EnvironmentMapAmount=0`
independently proves the amount also gates it; the indexed-draw dispatch path is exercised too.

`instanced3d.wgsl` / `GetOrCreatePipelineInstanced3D()` / `DrawInstancedPrimitivesEx()`
(`WEBGPU-27`/`38`/`68`) is the other half: a genuine second `WGPUVertexStepMode_Instance` vertex
buffer binding carrying a per-instance mat4 world transform, ported from `VulkanGraphicsBackend`'s
`instanced3d.{vert,frag}.glsl`. Unlike the bind-group-shaped families above, a second vertex stream
needs **no new bind group layout at all** in WebGPU (vertex buffers are set via
`wgpuRenderPassEncoderSetVertexBuffer()`, entirely separate from bind groups), so this reuses
`coloredBindGroupLayout_`/`coloredPipelineLayout_` unchanged; `[0..15]` of that UBO is
View×Projection rather than a full MVP, since world comes from the per-instance stream (matching
`FillInstancedPushConst()`'s own deliberate choice to ignore the caller's own `World` matrix
entirely). Unlike Vulkan's own hardcoded 64-byte instance-binding stride, this backend's pipeline
cache key genuinely includes both the per-vertex and per-instance buffer strides, so the GPU-side
binding always matches whatever the caller's buffers actually declare. `params.instanceVb ==
nullptr` falls back to a real `DrawIndexedPrimitivesEx()` draw rather than throwing, matching
`VulkanGraphicsBackend`'s identical fallback. `WebGPU_Instanced3D` (5/5, tested directly at the
`IGraphicsBackend` level, matching `examples/d3d9_instanced_test.cpp`'s own established
test-authoring convention for this API): 3 instances in ONE draw call each paint their own small
quad at their own independently-predicted screen location with the shared `DiffuseColor` — proving
the per-instance buffer is genuinely read per-instance, not e.g. always instance 0 or a hardcoded
2-instance special case — plus an untouched-background check and the null-`instanceVb` fallback.

## RenderTargetCube (2026-07-18)

`WebGPURenderTargetCubeBackend` (`WEBGPU-114`) is this backend's first real render-into-a-cube-face
support — before this, `CreateRenderTargetCube()` was `IGraphicsBackend`'s own nullptr-returning
default. It owns ONE shared 6-array-layer colour `WGPUTexture` (the same layout
`WebGPUTextureCubeBackend`, WEBGPU-56/113, already established for a plain `TextureCube`) plus ONE
shared `size`×`size` `Depth24PlusStencil8` depth+stencil texture reused across all 6 faces — safe
because only ONE face is ever bound/rendered-into at a time, mirroring
`VulkanRenderTargetCubeBackend`'s identical shared-depth-image choice. Each face gets its own
`WGPUTextureViewDimension_2D` view (the render-pass colour attachment); one further
`WGPUTextureViewDimension_Cube` view spans all 6 layers for sampling back.

Making a cube face act as its own distinct "target identity" for this backend's pre-existing
eager-flush-on-target-switch design (see the `RenderTarget2D` section above) needed generalising
that design's previously `RenderTarget2D`-only switch logic: `WebGPUGraphicsBackend::
FlushCurrentRenderTarget()` is a new shared entry point (factored out of the old inline
`SetRenderTarget2D`-only if/else) that flushes whichever of {backbuffer, a bound `RenderTarget2D`,
a bound `RenderTargetCube` face} is currently active, via a new `currentRenderTargetCubeFace_`/
`currentRenderTargetCubeFaceIndex_` pair mirroring the pre-existing `currentRenderTarget_` field.
This means switching directly between two DIFFERENT faces of the SAME (or a different)
`RenderTargetCube` — not just face↔backbuffer — still correctly flushes the outgoing face's own
render pass first, verified directly (`WebGPU_RenderTargetCube` Check A: all 6 faces bound
face-to-face with no intervening backbuffer switch, each reading back its own distinct `Clear()`
colour).

Sampling a `RenderTargetCube` back as `EnvironmentMapEffect.EnvironmentMap` needed one more small
piece: a new `IWebGPUCubeSamplable` interface (the cube-map sibling of the pre-existing
`IWebGPUSamplable`), implemented by BOTH `WebGPUTextureCubeBackend` and
`WebGPURenderTargetCubeBackend`, resolved via a safe `dynamic_cast` (`ResolveCubeSamplable()`).
Before this, `GpuDrawParams::envMap` was resolved via a `dynamic_cast` to the concrete
`WebGPUTextureCubeBackend` type ONLY, so a `RenderTargetCube` (a different concrete class) bound as
an env map would have silently failed that cast and rendered the 1x1 white-cube fallback instead of
its own real content — this is CNA's primary real-world `RenderTargetCube` use case (dynamic
reflection/environment maps), so this wiring matters as much as the render-into support itself.

Deliberately, honestly NOT implemented (documented scope cuts, not silently under-delivered): mip
regeneration (`mipMap=true` throws, matching `CreateRenderTarget2D`'s own precedent) and MSAA
(`multiSampleCount` is ignored; `GetMultiSampleCount()` always reports 0). `WebGPU_RenderTargetCube`
(12/12) verifies: 6-face direct face-to-face switching, a real `BasicEffect` 3D draw into a face,
the `EnvironmentMapEffect` sampling round trip above, the critical "an intervening cube-face-
targeted `Clear()` must not leak into the backbuffer's own render pass" architecture check (mirrors
the `RenderTarget2D` section's own Check E), `mipMap=true` throwing, and `MultiSampleCount`
honesty.

A genuinely new, previously-untested finding surfaced while writing this test (documented, not
fixed — pre-existing and backend-wide, not specific to `RenderTargetCube`): `QueueSprite()` computes
every sprite's clip-space geometry from the BACKBUFFER's own logical dimensions unconditionally,
never from whatever render target is currently bound. A `SpriteBatch.Draw()` issued while a
smaller/different-sized off-screen target is bound therefore does not necessarily cover the whole
bound target the way a caller would expect — confirmed empirically (a 32×32 cube face bound under a
64×64 backbuffer only had one quadrant painted by a destination-rect-(0,0,32,32) `SpriteBatch.Draw`
call). `webgpu_rendertargetcube_test.cpp`'s own Check C works around this by painting each face with
a real 3D (`BasicEffect`) draw instead of `SpriteBatch`, which is not subject to this backbuffer-
relative ortho mapping.

## Real mip generation for Texture2D/TextureCube (2026-07-18)

`WEBGPU-52`: previously, `mipMap=true` on a plain `Texture2D`/`TextureCube` only pre-allocated
empty GPU storage for levels 1+ — no content was ever generated from level 0. Investigating the
row's own originally-suggested technique (`wgpuCommandEncoderCopyTextureToTexture`) confirmed it is
a raw same-size copy in this project's pinned wgpu-native v29.0.1.1 — there is no
`vkCmdBlitImage`-equivalent filtered-downsample primitive in wgpu-native at all. The real technique
other WebGPU-based engines use, and the one implemented here
(`WebGPUGraphicsBackend::GenerateMipsForLayer()`, wrapped by `GenerateMips2D()`/
`GenerateMipsCubeFace()`): one render pass per mip level, each drawing a full-screen triangle (the
standard 3-vertex, no-vertex-buffer `@builtin(vertex_index)` trick — no `SpriteVertex`-style vertex
buffer needed) that samples the PREVIOUS level through a real `WGPUFilterMode_Linear` `WGPUSampler`
into the NEXT level's own single-mip-level render-attachment view. This is a genuine filtered
downsample, not a nearest-neighbor copy — proven directly by `webgpu_mipgen_test.cpp`'s hard-edged
red/blue stripe check, whose boundary destination pixel reads back an exact `(128,0,128)` 50/50
blend, not a hard unblended edge.

**Important, deliberate, honestly-documented divergence from FNA and every sibling CNA backend.**
`VulkanGraphicsBackend`/`EasyGLGraphicsBackend` only ever regenerate mip content for a RENDER
TARGET being unbound (`vkCmdBlitImage`/`glGenerateMipmap`-on-unbind, matching real FNA3D
`OPENGL_ResolveTarget` semantics) — neither backend, nor real FNA/XNA itself, auto-generates mip
content for a PLAIN `Texture2D`/`TextureCube` at all (mip levels beyond 0 are always
user/content-pipeline-supplied via explicit per-level `SetData()`, matching how a real XNA
content-pipeline-processed `.xnb` already carries every level pre-baked at content-build time —
there is no runtime "generate the rest from level 0" API anywhere in real XNA/FNA for a plain
texture). This WebGPU backend's mip generation DOES generate real content automatically instead,
triggered whenever content is written to level 0: `WebGPUTextureBackend::UpdatePixels()` (covers
both the constructor's initial pixel upload AND any later `Texture2D::SetData(level=0,...)` call,
since that XNA-layer method always re-uploads the whole level 0 via a CPU-side shadow buffer, even
for a partial-rectangle update) and `WebGPUTextureCubeBackend::SetData(face, level=0, ...)`
(per-face, on every call). This makes WebGPU's plain-texture mip behaviour strictly BETTER (never
garbage/undefined content at level>0) but genuinely DIFFERENT from FNA and every other CNA backend
for the identical public `Texture2D`/`TextureCube(mipMap=true)` constructor call. A later explicit
`SetData(level>0,...)` call is not retroactively protected — a subsequent level-0 write will
regenerate over it, exactly the same interaction a real mip chain has with itself.

`RenderTarget2D`/`RenderTargetCube` mip regeneration (the actual FNA-equivalent feature, matching
Vulkan/EasyGL's own render-target-only precedent) remains a separate, already-tracked, still-open
scope cut (see the `RenderTarget2D`/`RenderTargetCube` sections above) — this section's own work
does not touch either render-target class.

`webgpu_mipgen_test.cpp` (`WebGPU_MipGen` CTest, 9/9): a hard-edged red/blue vertical stripe
(deliberately NOT power-of-2-aligned with the 2:1 downsample's texel pairing, so a straddling
destination pixel actually exists) proves the genuine linear blend above for both `Texture2D` level
1 and one `TextureCube` face's level 1; a chain-downsampled level 2 (sourced from level 1, not
level 0, proving the per-level loop chains correctly) has real, plausible, non-garbage content; and
`mipMap=false` construction with non-empty pixel data does not crash.

## Implemented baseline

The initial backend is deliberately useful rather than an empty scaffold. It currently provides:

- backend selection and `CNA_BACKEND_WEBGPU` build wiring;
- native SDL3 surface creation for Win32, macOS/Metal, Linux/X11 and Linux/Wayland, with an
  Android native-window path compiled when the required SDL property is available;
- instance, adapter, device and queue initialization with device-lost and uncaptured-error
  reporting;
- surface capability selection, resize reconfiguration and FIFO/Immediate/Mailbox present-mode
  selection from CNA's swap interval;
- back-buffer acquisition, command encoding, color/depth/stencil clears, submission and present;
- RGBA8 `Texture2D` creation, level uploads and mip-chain allocation;
- 16-bit and 32-bit index-buffer uploads plus generic vertex-buffer uploads;
- a WGSL SpriteBatch pipeline with tint, source rectangle, destination rectangle, rotation,
  origin, layer depth, transforms, flips, linear/nearest filtering and wrap/clamp/mirror sampler
  caching;
- CNA logical-presentation modes and window/logical coordinate conversion.

## Important limitations

This is **not yet equivalent to CNA's Vulkan, EasyGL or Bgfx 3D backends**. The following remain
open in `plan_webgpu.md`:

- `BasicEffect`, `AlphaTestEffect`, `DualTextureEffect`, `PbrEffect`, `SkinnedEffect`,
  `SkinnedPbrEffect`, `EnvironmentMapEffect` real dispatch and real instancing
  (`DrawInstancedPrimitivesEx()`) are all now implemented, see above. `RenderTargetCube` (cube
  render targets) is now implemented too, see below; `TextureCube`/`RenderTargetCube` mip
  regeneration remains open;
- single-target `RenderTarget2D` AND `RenderTargetCube` (colour + depth/stencil round trip, real
  3D-draw dispatch, sampling back through `EnvironmentMapEffect`) are now implemented, see below;
  real GPU-native compressed texture formats (`WEBGPU-111`) and multiple simultaneous render
  targets (MRT) remain open. Compressed formats are a cross-backend/XNA-layer gap, not a
  WebGPU-specific one -- no CNA backend does real block-compressed GPU upload today (`Texture2D`
  always CPU-decompresses DXT source content to RGBA8 first, and the common `ImageData` struct has
  no field for a compressed format at all); the real adapter on the development machine used to
  investigate this DOES support `WGPUFeatureName_TextureCompressionBC`, so this is a genuine future
  design task, not a hardware dead end. MSAA
  (backbuffer and render target) is now implemented and verified end-to-end — global sample count,
  clamped `ApplyMultiSampleCount()`, RT mirroring, and genuine multisample-resolved rendering all
  work (`WebGPU_Msaa`, 6/6) — see `WEBGPU-58`. A `RenderTarget2D`'s own per-instance
  `multiSampleCount` constructor parameter is still intentionally ignored (it always mirrors the
  backend's global sample count instead);
- `Texture2D.GetData()` (arbitrary-texture readback — distinct from the now-implemented backbuffer
  readback, `WEBGPU-51`);
- full BlendState, RasterizerState (cull mode/wireframe), viewport, scissor and stencil-operation
  mapping (`DepthStencilState`'s *depth* portion is implemented, see below);
- custom SpriteBatch effects and custom WGSL effects;
- browser/Emscripten WebGPU; this first implementation is the native wgpu-native backend.

`GetBackBufferData()` and a first real 3D draw path (`DrawColoredPrimitives`/
`DrawIndexedColoredPrimitives`, with genuine depth testing) are implemented — see below. Interface
methods still not overridden by this backend retain the common backend's existing unsupported/
default behavior (mostly silent no-ops, by `IGraphicsBackend`'s own design for state setters).

## Architecture notes

WebGPU and Vulkan are conceptually related explicit APIs, so the Vulkan backend informed resource
lifetime, surface recovery, command encoding and render-pass structure. The implementation is not a
line-by-line Vulkan translation:

- WebGPU uses WGSL shader modules rather than CNA's Vulkan SPIR-V modules.
- Resource bindings use bind-group layouts and bind groups rather than Vulkan descriptor sets.
- WebGPU has no push constants, so future 3D effect data will use uniform buffers.
- Pipeline state is largely immutable and must eventually be represented in a pipeline cache.
- Native surface creation is performed directly from SDL3 window properties; CNA does not require
  the separate `sdl3webgpu` compatibility library.

See `plan_webgpu.md` for task-level status and the remaining parity work.
