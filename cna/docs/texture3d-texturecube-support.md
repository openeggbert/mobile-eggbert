# Texture3D / TextureCube Backend Support — CNA

> Source-inspected against Tasks 271–279 (Phase 33).
> Covers: EasyGL, Vulkan, Bgfx backends. SDL_Renderer has no 3D texture support at all
> (2D-only backend, `CreateTexture3D`/`CreateTextureCube` are unreachable from any XNA-level
> API — `Texture3D`/`TextureCube` construction goes through `GraphicsDevice::GetBackend()`,
> and SDL_Renderer's 3D-facing factory methods throw `ThrowNo3D` the same way vertex buffers do).

## Legend

| Symbol | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| ✅ | Fully supported and verified with a passing test this session. |
| ⚠️ | Works for the common case, with a real, documented caveat. |
| ❌ | Missing or silently wrong; confirmed by reading the implementation. |
| 🔍 | Same code pattern as a confirmed bug elsewhere, but not independently reproduced with a test — flagged as likely, not confirmed. |

---

## Construction (`Texture3D`/`TextureCube` constructors)

| Backend | `mipMap` respected? | `SurfaceFormat` respected? |
|---------|:---:|:---:|
| EasyGL  | ⚠️ `TextureCube` only (Task 276 fix) — see "Mip levels" below | ❌ always `Rgba8`, `format` parameter ignored |
| Vulkan  | ❌ dropped in the factory itself — `CreateTexture3D`/`CreateTextureCube` take `bool /*mipMap*/` (commented out) | ❌ always `VK_FORMAT_R8G8B8A8_UNORM` |
| Bgfx    | ⚠️ `TextureCube` — parameter is received but the constructor still hardcodes `bgfx::createTextureCube(size, /*hasMips=*/false, ...)`, so it does nothing today (🔍 same class of bug as Task 276, not yet fixed for Bgfx) | ❌ always `bgfx::TextureFormat::RGBA8` |

No backend implements `SurfaceFormat` for `Texture3D`/`TextureCube` — every format request silently
becomes 32-bit RGBA. This is a pre-existing, cross-backend limitation, not something introduced or
fixed this session.

## `SetData` — box / rect sub-region uploads

Verified this session (Tasks 273–275) that CNA's public API layer (`Texture3D::SetData`,
`TextureCube::SetData`) correctly computes arbitrary x/y/z (or x/y, for `TextureCube`) sub-region
offsets and forwards them to the backend — asymmetric, off-origin, single-voxel, and far-corner
boxes all round-trip correctly through **EasyGL**.

| Backend | Arbitrary sub-region upload | Verified how |
|---------|:---:|---|
| EasyGL  | ✅ | `glTexSubImage3D`/`glTexSubImage2D` per-face, pixel-verified (Tasks 273–275) |
| Vulkan  | 🔍 | `vkCmdCopyBufferToImage` with `imageOffset`/`imageExtent` set from `x,y,z,w,h,depth` — code inspection shows this is correct, but not independently pixel-verified this session (Vulkan has no `GetData` readback to verify against — see below) |
| Bgfx    | 🔍 | `bgfx::updateTexture3D`/`updateTextureCube` forward the same offsets — code inspection only; Bgfx has no readback API to verify against either |

---

## `GetData` — readback

**This is the most significant finding of this documentation task.** `Texture3D`/`TextureCube` have
no CPU-side shadow buffer (unlike `Texture2D`'s `cpuPixels_`) — `GetData` depends entirely on the
backend's `ITexture3DBackend`/`ITextureCubeBackend::GetData` implementation.

| Backend | `GetData` implemented? |
|---------|:---:|
| EasyGL  | ✅ — per-slice (`Texture3D`) or per-face (`TextureCube`) temporary FBO + `glReadPixels`. Pixel-verified round-trip (Tasks 273–275). |
| Vulkan  | ❌ **total no-op.** Neither `VulkanTexture3DBackend` nor `VulkanTextureCubeBackend` overrides `GetData` — both fall through to `ITexture3DBackend`/`ITextureCubeBackend`'s base-class default (`virtual void GetData(...) const {}`, an empty body). Calling `Texture3D::GetData`/`TextureCube::GetData` on Vulkan silently leaves the caller's output buffer **completely untouched** — not zeroed, just whatever was already there. No exception, no error, no log message. |
| Bgfx    | ❌ **total no-op**, same reason (no override, falls through to the same empty base-class default). Consistent with Bgfx's already-documented project-wide "no GPU readback API" limitation, but this is the first place that limitation is confirmed to apply specifically to `Texture3D`/`TextureCube`. |

**Why the existing test suite didn't already catch this:** `Texture3DTests.cpp`/`TextureCubeTests.cpp`'s
`GetData*` unit tests are argument-guard tests only (null data throws, negative `startIndex` throws,
out-of-bounds rect throws, "WithinBoundsDoesNotThrow") — none of them assert on the *value* `GetData`
actually returns. Running the full suite against `cmake-build-vulkan`/`cmake-build-bgfx` reports
"34/34 `TextureCubeTest` pass" (confirmed during Task 279) — which is entirely consistent with
`GetData` being a silent no-op, since no existing test checks the returned pixels. Only EasyGL has a
dedicated pixel-readback integration test (`examples/easygl_texturecube_faces_test.cpp`, etc.), which
is why this went unnoticed until this task cross-checked the Vulkan/Bgfx backend source directly.

Not fixed here — this is a real feature gap (Vulkan needs a staging-buffer-based
`vkCmdCopyImageToBuffer` readback path; Bgfx has no such API in this project by design), tracked as
new `plan_graphics.md` Task 865.

## Mip levels (`level` > 0)

| Backend | `Texture3D` level>0 | `TextureCube` level>0 |
|---------|:---:|:---:|
| EasyGL  | 🔍 same bug class as the confirmed `TextureCube` bug below, not yet fixed — tracked as Task 862 | ✅ fixed and pixel-verified (Task 276): constructor now pre-allocates every mip level per face |
| Vulkan  | 🔍 `imgInfo.mipLevels = 1` hardcoded at image creation, `mipMap` param dropped by the factory | 🔍 same — `imgInfo.mipLevels = 1` hardcoded |
| Bgfx    | 🔍 `bgfx::createTexture3D(..., /*hasMips=*/false, ...)` — `mipMap` param received but ignored | 🔍 same — `bgfx::createTextureCube(..., /*hasMips=*/false, ...)` |

Task 276 confirmed (via a failing-then-fixed test) that this exact bug shape — "constructor never
allocates GPU storage past level 0, so a sub-image write to `level>0` silently goes nowhere" —
is real for `EasyGLTextureCubeBackend`. Every other cell in this table has the **identical code
shape** (mip level count/flag hardcoded to "1 level only", `mipMap` parameter unused), so the same
failure is highly likely everywhere else, but only the one cell was actually reproduced with a
test and fixed. Tracked as new `plan_graphics.md` Task 862 (EasyGL `Texture3D`, already tracked)
and Task 864 (Vulkan + Bgfx, both types — new).

---

## `CubeMapFace` validation

Fixed this session (Task 279): `TextureCube::SetData`/`GetData` now throw `std::out_of_range` for
an out-of-range `CubeMapFace` value, at the public API layer, on all backends (the check lives in
`TextureCube.cpp`, above the backend dispatch). FNA itself never validates this — confirmed via
`TextureCube.cs` — so this is a CNA safety extra. All 3 backends already guarded against an invalid
face internally too (`if (face < 0 || face >= 6) return;`), so this was already memory-safe before
Task 279; the fix only changes silent-no-op into a clear exception.

---

## Sampling in shaders

| Use case | EasyGL | Vulkan | Bgfx |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| `TextureCube` in `EnvironmentMapEffect` | ✅ (pre-existing, reconfirmed) | ✅ (pre-existing, reconfirmed) | ✅ (Task 278 — was a silent no-reflection fallback, now fixed) |
| `Texture3D` in any effect, stock or custom | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |

`Texture3D` sampling is not implemented on any backend for a structural reason, not a per-backend
gap: `Texture3D`/`TextureCube` don't inherit `Texture` in CNA (unlike FNA's `Texture3D : Texture`),
so neither can be placed into `GraphicsDevice.Textures[slot]`, and custom `ShaderEffect` has no
texture-binding API of any kind (Task 277 finding, tracked as Task 863). `TextureCube` sampling
*does* work for `EnvironmentMapEffect` specifically because that stock effect bypasses
`GraphicsDevice.Textures` entirely via a dedicated `GpuDrawParams::envMap` field that every backend's
draw dispatch consumes directly — but no stock effect needs `Texture3D`, and no custom-effect
workaround exists for it.

---

## `DDSFromStreamEXT` (`TextureCube` only — no `Texture3D` equivalent in FNA)

Confirmed non-functional stub on all backends (it's implemented once, in the shared XNA-layer
`TextureCube.cpp`, not per-backend): ignores the `stream` argument entirely and always returns a
blank 1×1 `Color` cube map. Task 272 finding, tracked as `plan_graphics.md` Task 663.

## Future work

| Area | Task |
|------|------|
| Fix `EasyGLTexture3DBackend`'s mip-level allocation (same bug as Task 276, `Texture3D` only) | Task 862 |
| Wire `Texture3D`/`TextureCube` sampling into shaders (architecture change — inherit `Texture`, or a parallel binding path) | Task 863 |
| Fix Vulkan's and Bgfx's mip-level allocation for both `Texture3D` and `TextureCube` (`mipLevels`/`hasMips` hardcoded to 1/false) | Task 864 (new) |
| Implement real GPU readback for `Texture3D`/`TextureCube::GetData` on Vulkan (staging-buffer `vkCmdCopyImageToBuffer`); document Bgfx's as an accepted no-readback limitation | Task 865 (new) |
| Implement `TextureCube::DDSFromStreamEXT` for real (DDS header parsing + per-face/per-level DXT decode) | Task 663 |
