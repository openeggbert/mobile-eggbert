# Established graphics backend feature matrix — SDL_Renderer, EasyGL, Vulkan, Bgfx, D3D9, D3D11, D3D12

Master, up-to-date cross-backend feature matrix for CNA's established backends, written for
Task 451 (Phase 51), extended 2026-07-14 with a `D3D11` column (`../plan_dx.md`, Phase DX11
`DX-96`), then a `D3D12` column (Phase DX12 `DX-115`) the same day, then a `D3D9` column
(`../plan_dx9.md`, `D9-130`) 2026-07-15, once each backend's feature set was broad enough for a
meaningful row-by-row comparison. The experimental WebGPU backend is intentionally tracked
separately in [`webgpu-backend.md`](webgpu-backend.md) and `../plan_webgpu.md` until its feature
surface is broad enough for meaningful parity columns.

**A `D3D11`/`D3D12` cell means "verified through Wine+DXVK/vkd3d-proton on this dev machine's real
GPU," not "verified on real Windows hardware"** — see `docs/d3d11-backend.md`/`docs/d3d12-backend.md`'s
own "Known limitations" for the real-Windows gate (`plan_dx.md` `DX-90`/`DX-91` for D3D11, `DX-114`
for D3D12) that still applies on top of every ✅ below. **`D3D12`'s own *routine CTest* checks are all
off-screen** — swap-chain creation and `Present()`/back-buffer rendering are real and proven through a
live window (`plan_dx.md` `DX-102`/`DX-116`), but only via a separate manual diagnostic through a
Proton-managed launch (`scripts/run-proton-vkd3d.sh`), not the routine `D3D12_Smoke` CTest — see
`docs/d3d12-backend.md`. So a `D3D12` ✅ below means "real off-screen GPU pixel/behavior proof,"
unless the row is specifically about presentation itself. A cell is only marked ✅ if a real,
GPU-facing pixel/behavior check actually exercised it; anything implemented but not independently
pixel-tested is marked 🟨, and anything not attempted/not built at all is marked ⬜ (distinct from
this doc's own ❌, which means "tested and found to genuinely not work").

**The `D3D9` column measures something narrower and stricter than the other columns: pixel-for-pixel
indistinguishability from the real XNA 4.0 runtime**, not just "feature works." A `D3D9` ✅ means the
feature is exercised by `tools/xna-oracle/`'s checked-in scene corpus (`D9-120`, `D3D9_XNA_Diff`
CTest) and its render is byte-identical (`--tolerance 0`) to the real XNA 4.0 runtime's own render of
the same scene — a strictly stronger bar than any other column's ✅. Like `D3D11`/`D3D12`, this is
"verified through Wine+DXVK on this dev machine's real GPU," not real Windows hardware (`D9-140`,
open). See `docs/d3d9-backend.md` and `docs/d3d9-divergence-report.md` for the full detail this
column's cells summarize.

The **Headless** backend (`CNA_GRAPHICS_BACKEND=HEADLESS`, tracked in `../plan_headless.md`) is deliberately
**not** a column in this matrix: it never renders a single pixel, so none of the below
correctness/parity rows are meaningful for it. It exists for a different purpose entirely — running
game logic headlessly (no window, no GPU, no display server) for fast CI tests — and validates
itself via argument checks, resource-lifecycle tracking, and draw-call/state-change counters instead
of pixel output. See `plan_headless.md` for its own status.

The **Software** backend (`CNA_GRAPHICS_BACKEND=SOFTWARE`, tracked in `../plan_software.md`) is
also **not yet** a column here, but for a different reason than Headless: unlike Headless, it
*does* render real pixels (a genuine CPU rasterizer), so it could plausibly become a real
pixel-parity comparison column once its feature set is broad enough — v1 only covers `TriangleList`,
a `BasicEffect` subset (no lighting/fog), nearest-neighbor texturing, and a simplified
`Opaque`/`AlphaBlend` distinction, too narrow for a meaningful row-by-row comparison against the
established backends yet. Worth revisiting as `plan_software.md`'s scope grows. See
`docs/software-backend.md` for its current capability boundary.

**Supersedes `docs/coverage.md`**, which is dated 2026-06-21
and predates almost this entire session's work
(dozens of real bugs fixed across all 4 backends, an entire SDL_Renderer 2D-only audit phase,
Model/OcclusionQuery correctness phases) and never covered SDL_Renderer at all. `docs/coverage.md`
is kept for its still-accurate non-Graphics namespace estimates (Audio/Media/Content/Net/
GamerServices); this doc is Graphics-only and current.

Status legend: ✅ correct and verified · ⚠️ partial/emulated/environment-limited · ❌ known gap, not
fixed · ⛔ BLOCKED, needs a project-owner architecture decision · 🟨 implemented but not
independently verified (D3D9/D3D11/D3D12 columns only, see above) · ⬜ not attempted this session
(D3D9/D3D11/D3D12 columns only).

## 2D SpriteBatch / SpriteFont

| Feature | EasyGL | Vulkan | Bgfx | SDL_Renderer | D3D9 | D3D11 | D3D12 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| All `Draw` overloads, sort modes, rotation/flip/scale/crop | ✅ | not separately re-audited (Task 861) | not separately re-audited | ✅ (2 real bugs fixed: rotation pivot, `transformMatrix`) | ✅ real Microsoft `SpriteEffect.fx`, oracle-verified 0-divergence for rotation (`sprite_rotated_quad`), flip (`sprite_flipped_quad`), multi-texture batching (`sprite_multitexture_quad`), and 3 of 5 `SpriteSortMode` values (`Deferred`/`BackToFront`/`FrontToBack`, `D9-93`); `.Immediate`/`.Texture` confirmed not oracle-viable, not a coverage gap — see `docs/d3d9-backend.md` | ✅ destination-rect placement + `SpriteEffects::FlipHorizontally` (`DX-70`) plus rotation/scale/source-crop-rect, real geometrically-derived pixel proof (`DX-131`, Checks Y2–Y4); `SpriteSortMode` deliberately has no dedicated test — its ordering logic lives entirely in shared, backend-agnostic `SpriteBatch.cpp` | ✅ same rotation/scale/crop proof, off-screen (`DX-131`, Checks R4–R6) — needed widening the fixture to 2 texels per color to account for D3D12's default bilinear sampler; `SpriteSortMode` same shared-code reasoning as D3D11 |
| Custom `Effect` via `Begin(effect)` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ throws by design (no shader stage, 2D-only backend) | ✅ **row corrected 2026-07-16 — was stale.** Real color-inversion custom-GLSL shader via `D3D9EffectBackend` (runtime `D3DCompile()`), through the real public `SpriteBatch.Begin(effect)` API (`D9-110`/`D9-111`/`D9-112`, Phase D9-11 closed 2026-07-15) — this cell previously said "not started," written before that phase landed | ✅ real color-inversion custom-HLSL pixel test (`DX-71`) | ✅ same color-inversion methodology (byte-for-byte identical HLSL contract), through the real public XNA API off-screen via a windowless `GraphicsDevice` (`DX-121`, Checks NN0/NN1) |
| SpriteFont — glyph placement/spacing/newline/fallback/flip | ✅ pixel-verified (Tasks 424-429) | not separately re-audited (Task 861) | not separately re-audited | ✅ (1 real cross-backend bug found and fixed, Task 694) | ⬜ not attempted this backend | ✅ exact glyph placement (checked inside + all 4 edge midpoints), per-glyph advance, newline line-drop+x-reset, `FlipVertically` via an asymmetric glyph — real pixel proof through the back buffer (`DX-127`) | ✅ same proof, through a windowless `GraphicsDevice` (`PresentationParameters::HeadlessEXT`) + a real `RenderTarget2D` (`DX-132`) |
| `TextureAddressMode::Wrap`/`Mirror` via SpriteBatch | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ⛔ **BLOCKED** (Tasks 686/687) | ✅ real `D3DSAMP_ADDRESSU`/`V`, oracle-verified: distinct 4-band tiling (Wrap) vs. symmetric mirroring pattern (Mirror), proven genuinely different from each other, not just "some non-Clamp behavior" (`D9-92`, `sprite_wrap_quad`/`sprite_mirror_quad`) | ✅ real `D3D11SamplerCache`-backed Wrap/Mirror with discriminating probe pixels (`DX-72`) | ✅ real `D3D12SamplerCache`-backed Wrap/Mirror, same probe-pixel methodology as D3D11 (`DX-133`) — found and fixed a real bug along the way: `SpriteBatch` draws previously silently used whatever sampler an unrelated prior 3D draw left bound, `SetSamplerFilter`/`SetSamplerAddressMode` were stored but inert |

Note: several per-effect `docs/*-support.md` files (e.g. `basiceffect-support.md`) predate Tasks
885-900's fog/lighting/specular fixes on Vulkan/Bgfx and still show some of these rows as gaps —
this matrix reflects the current, post-fix state; those individual docs are due for a refresh but
not rewritten here (out of this task's own scope).

## RenderTarget / MSAA / mip / depth

| Feature | EasyGL | Vulkan | Bgfx | SDL_Renderer | D3D9 | D3D11 | D3D12 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `RenderTarget2D`/`RenderTargetCube`/MRT construction | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ (MRT count > 1 throws by design, Task 709) | ✅ **row corrected 2026-07-16 — the crash below is fixed.** `MaxRenderTargets` `GraphicsProfile` ceiling (Reach=1/HiDef=4) real and mutation-verified (`D9-103`); full construction/bind/clear/readback pixel-verified (`D3D9_Smoke` Checks S/T/U). The reproducible, uncaught DXVK crash this cell used to describe (sampling a `RenderTarget2D` as an ordinary effect texture) was root-caused and fixed 2026-07-16 — a real CNA-side type-confusion bug (`static_cast` between the unrelated sibling classes `D3D9TextureBackend`/`D3D9RenderTargetBackend`), not a DXVK/environment limitation (see `NEXT.md` §4). No `D9-A5` oracle scene exercises this path yet, though — that remains open, separately from the crash | ✅ `RenderTarget2D` full bind+clear+readback+unbind-restores-backbuffer pixel-verified; real 2-target MRT bind+independent-clear verified via one `OMSetRenderTargets` call (`plan_dx.md` `DX-43`/`DX-46`); `RenderTargetCube` also has the full bind+clear+readback+unbind proof plus a per-face independence check (`DX-129`) | ✅ **stale row, corrected 2026-07-14** — a real public `D3D12RenderTargetBackend`/`D3D12RenderTargetCubeBackend` landed in Phase DX13 (`plan_dx.md` `DX-117`): real `RenderTarget2D` bind+clear+readback+unbind, real 2-target MRT, `RenderTargetCube` face-0 bind+clear+readback+unbind, all pixel-verified. This row previously described a pre-Phase-DX13 state and had not been updated since |
| MSAA (both RT types) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ (`Bgfx_RenderTarget2D_MsaaResolve` fails only under this session's Xvfb/no-DRI3 sandbox, not a code bug) | N/A (2D-only, no AA needed) | ⬜ not attempted — the render-target-as-texture crash that used to block this is fixed (2026-07-16, see the row above), but no oracle scene exercises `RenderTarget2D`/`RenderTargetCube` MSAA yet | ✅ `RenderTarget2D` 4x MSAA clear+resolve pixel-verified, device-queried via `CheckMultisampleQualityLevels` (`DX-45`); `RenderTargetCube` MSAA now also real, face-scoped resolve via a plain (non-cube) MSAA `Texture2DMSArray` + a separate cube-flagged resolve texture (`DX-152`) | ✅ `RenderTarget2D` 4x MSAA clear+resolve pixel-verified, device-queried via `CheckFeatureSupport(D3D12_FEATURE_MULTISAMPLE_QUALITY_LEVELS)`, resolved via real `ResolveSubresource()` on unbind (`DX-117` follow-up, Checks OO0/OO1); `RenderTargetCube` MSAA now also real, same face-scoped resolve design (`DX-152`, Checks SS0/SS1) |
| Mip chains (both RT types) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | N/A | ⬜ not attempted — same as MSAA above: no longer crash-blocked (2026-07-16), just not yet oracle-covered | ✅ `RenderTarget2D` real (driver `GenerateMips()`, box-filtered content pixel-verified per level) + `RenderTargetCube` real for face 0 (`DX-144`) and a non-zero face (`DX-153`, confirming the whole-resource `GenerateMips()` call genuinely regenerates whichever face was just drawn to) | ✅ `RenderTarget2D` real (CPU box-filter downsample cascade on unbind, box-filtered content pixel-verified per level) + `RenderTargetCube` real for face 0 (`DX-144`) and a non-zero face (`DX-153`, confirming the `activeFace_`-scoped cascade and its subresource math generalize past face 0) |
| Per-instance `DepthStencilFormat` fidelity | ✅ | ✅ (Task 911) | ✅ | ⚠️ emulated (echoes the requested format back, no real backing storage) | ⬜ not attempted — same as MSAA/mip above: no longer crash-blocked (2026-07-16), just not yet oracle-covered | ✅ real GPU-resource-level format introspection — `None` creates no depth resource at all, `Depth16` genuinely lands on `D16_UNORM` (not silently upgraded), `Depth24`/`Depth24Stencil8` both genuinely share the same `D24_UNORM_S8_UINT` fallback (`DX-145`) | ✅ same real resource-level introspection, off-screen (`DX-145`, Checks II0–II3) |

### Bgfx MRT attachment limits (Task 775)

`GraphicsDevice::SetRenderTargets` throws `std::invalid_argument` above **4** targets in shared C++
code (`MAX_RENDERTARGET_BINDINGS`, Task 881) — mirroring FNA's own real
`internal const int MAX_RENDERTARGET_BINDINGS = 4` cap — before any backend ever sees the call, so
this is the practical, enforced limit on Bgfx (and every other backend) regardless of what the
underlying device itself could support. `BgfxGraphicsBackend::SetRenderTargets`'s own MRT
framebuffer-construction path (`BgfxGraphicsBackend.cpp`) separately caps at a local
`kMaxAttachments = 8`, matching bgfx's own `BGFX_CONFIG_MAX_FRAME_BUFFER_ATTACHMENTS` compile-time
default — unreachable in practice today since the shared 4-target gate rejects anything larger
first, kept only as defense-in-depth (same reasoning as Task 881's own EasyGL/Bgfx ad-hoc-cap
notes). The real device capability, `bgfx::getCaps()->limits.maxFBAttachments`, is logged at
startup (Task 456) and is typically 8 on desktop GL/Vulkan hardware — always ≥ the FNA-mandated 4,
so it has never been the binding constraint in this project.

## Texture2D / Texture3D / TextureCube

| Feature | EasyGL | Vulkan | Bgfx | SDL_Renderer | D3D9 | D3D11 | D3D12 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Texture2D `SetData`/`GetData`/`FromStream`/`SaveAsPng`/NPOT | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ (4 real bugs found and fixed) | ✅ real `D3DPOOL_MANAGED` upload, exercised (and oracle-verified byte-exact) by every textured scene in the corpus (`texturepixel=` used 64×); `FromStream`/`SaveAsPng`/NPOT-on-`Reach` not separately tested | ✅ `SetData`/`GetData` byte-exact GPU round-trip verified (`DX-40`); NPOT (a genuinely non-power-of-two 5×3 texture) and `FromStream`/`SaveAsPng` (real PNG encode/decode round-trip, every pixel of a varying pattern) both real (`DX-140`) | ✅ same coverage, off-screen — NPOT also exercises the `D3D12_TEXTURE_DATA_PITCH_ALIGNMENT` row-pitch edge case a 5×3 width creates; `FromStream`/`SaveAsPng` needed `PresentationParameters::HeadlessEXT` (a windowless `GraphicsDevice`) to reach at all (`DX-140`, Checks GG0–GG2/KK7–KK9) |
| Texture2D mip-level `SetData` (level > 0) | ✅ | ❌ silent no-op (Task 867) | ❌ silent no-op (Task 867) | ❌ throws by design (Task 681) | ⬜ not attempted — no oracle scene exercises mip level > 0 | ✅ real, deterministic direct-GPU-readback proof — `UpdatePixelsLevel(1,...)` round-trips exact bytes, and level 0's own content is independently confirmed unaffected (`DX-126`) | ✅ same direct-readback proof, off-screen (`DX-141`, Checks HH0–HH2) |
| Texture3D/TextureCube `SetData`/`GetData`, incl. mip | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ (needed a new `GetData` readback path, Task 914) | ⛔ **BLOCKED** — construction succeeds silently with a null backend, 94-test blast radius (Task 725) | 🟨 split: `TextureCube` `SetData` real, oracle-verified byte-exact via `envmap_quad`/`envmap_fresnel_quad`; `Texture3D` has only its `GraphicsProfile` size-ceiling mutation-verified (`D9-103`) — no oracle scene or GPU round-trip test exists for `Texture3D` at all | ✅ byte-exact GPU round-trip verified for both types at mip 0 (`DX-41`/`DX-42`) | ✅ real `D3D12Texture3DBackend` (`DX-122`, byte-exact off-center sub-volume round-trip); real `D3D12TextureCubeBackend::GetData()` readback (`DX-123`, no longer a no-op — proven per-face-distinct and genuinely reads live GPU content, not CPU poison values) |
| Texture3D/TextureCube sampled in shaders | ❌ don't inherit `Texture` (Task 863, architectural) | ❌ | ❌ | N/A | 🟨 `TextureCube` sampled and oracle-verified byte-exact via `EnvironmentMapEffect` (`envmap_quad`/`envmap_fresnel_quad`); `Texture3D` has no consuming shader variant tested | 🟨 `TextureCube` sampled and pixel-verified via `env_map3d` (`DX-66`); `Texture3D` has no consuming shader variant, unverified in a shader | 🟨 `TextureCube` sampled and pixel-verified via `env_map3d` (`DX-111`, Check U1); `Texture3D` has a real backend (`DX-122`) but still no consuming shader variant, unverified in a shader |
| Non-`Color` `SurfaceFormat` for real GPU texture data | ⛔ **BLOCKED** (Task 732) | same shared-code limitation | same | same | same shared-code limitation | same shared-code limitation | same shared-code limitation |

## GraphicsDevice state objects

| Feature | EasyGL | Vulkan | Bgfx | SDL_Renderer | D3D9 | D3D11 | D3D12 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `BlendState` (all presets + custom factors/equations) | ✅ | ✅ **FIXED (Task 868, 2026-07-09)** — real per-`Blend`/`BlendFunction` mapping across all 9 3D pipeline-creation sites; was "almost entirely fake" (hardcoded one blend equation regardless of request, confirmed 5× via pixel tests) before this fix | ✅ | ✅ (2 real bugs fixed) | ✅ real `D3DRS_SRCBLEND`/`DESTBLEND` per-preset dispatch, `Opaque`/`AlphaBlend` pixel-behavior-verified (`D3D9_BlendState_Opaque`/`_AlphaBlend`) and separately mutation-verified (src/dst swap caught, `D9-122`) | ✅ real cached `ID3D11BlendState`, `Opaque`/`AlphaBlend` pixel-behavior-verified (`DX-50`/`DX-82`) | ✅ real runtime-settable `BlendState`→PSO-description-key mapping, replacing the old hardcoded PSO defaults (`DX-118`); a real `ApplyBlendState(One,One,Add)` genuinely additive-blends a second draw, and reverting to `Opaque` genuinely restores it, off-screen (Checks X1–X3) |
| `DepthStencilState` (compare func + full stencil ops) | ✅ | ✅ (Task 870 — real per-pipeline compare-op + stencil) | not separately re-confirmed this pass | ✅ never throws (deliberate no-op, matches FNA's backend-agnostic-until-drawn model) | ✅ real `D3DRS_STENCILENABLE`/compare-func dispatch, pixel-verified (`D3D9_DepthStencilState_StencilEnable`) and mutation-verified (forced-false caught, `D9-122`) | ✅ real cached `ID3D11DepthStencilState`, stencil-enable gating pixel-verified (`DX-51`/`DX-82`) | ✅ real runtime-settable `DepthStencilState`→PSO mapping (`DX-118`), replacing the old hardcoded `depthEnable=false`; a real per-pixel `LessEqual` depth comparison proven both draw orders (near-then-far rejects far, far-then-near lets near overwrite) plus a depth-disabled control (Checks Y2–Y4); combo `Clear*`/stencil-plane behavior separately proven (`DX-146`) |
| `RasterizerState` | ✅ | not separately re-confirmed this pass | not separately re-confirmed this pass | ✅ never throws | ✅ real `D3DRS_CULLMODE` winding-order dispatch, pixel-verified (`D3D9_RasterizerState_CullMode`) and mutation-verified (forced-none caught, `D9-122`); depth-bias not separately tested — see this doc's own "Remaining genuine D3D9 limitations" section for `D9-62`'s own outstanding depth-bias oracle-proof attempt (investigated 2026-07-16, not closed: no observable effect at any tested magnitude, suspected environment/driver limitation shared with `Vulkan_DepthBias`) | ✅ real cached `ID3D11RasterizerState`, `CullMode` winding-order pixel-verified (`DX-52`/`DX-82`); depth-bias unit convention (float→rounded `INT`) documented, not itself pixel-tested | ✅ real runtime-settable `RasterizerState`→PSO mapping (`DX-118`), replacing the old hardcoded `cullMode=None`; `CullCounterClockwiseFace` genuinely culls, `CullMode::None` genuinely draws the same triangle, off-screen (Checks X4/X5) |
| Per-slot `SamplerState` (16 slots) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ (1 real bug fixed) | 🟨 real `D3DSAMP_ADDRESSU`/`V`/`MAGFILTER`/`MINFILTER` wiring, Wrap/Mirror pixel-behavior oracle-verified via SpriteBatch (`D9-92`); not tested across all 16 slots simultaneously | ✅ real cache with identity/distinctness proof + Wrap/Mirror pixel-verified via SpriteBatch (`DX-44`/`DX-72`), plus all 16 slots proven simultaneously independent (`DX-142`) | ✅ real dynamic per-slot samplers (`D3D12SamplerCache`, `DX-119`, replacing the old single hardcoded static sampler), Wrap-vs-Clamp discriminating pixel proof + cache identity/distinctness (Checks Z1–Z4), plus all 16 slots proven simultaneously independent (`DX-154`, Checks UU0/UU1) |
| `GraphicsDevice.ReferenceStencil` | ❌ **no backend connection** (Task 872, open) | ✅ **FIXED** — connected via `vkCmdSetStencilReference`, an undocumented side effect of Task 870 (corrected 2026-07-09) | ❌ **no backend connection** (Task 872, open) | N/A | ⬜ not attempted — no D3D9 test exercises `SetReferenceStencil()` | ✅ real `OMSetDepthStencilState` re-bind on `SetReferenceStencil()`, verified (`DX-52`) | ⬜ not applicable — no depth-stencil-state object exists to carry a reference value |
| `Clear` honors `ClearOptions::Stencil` | ❌ **ignored, all 3** (Task 871, open) | ❌ | ❌ | ⚠️ emulated | ⬜ not attempted — `D3D9_Smoke` covers plain `Clear(r,g,b,a)` only, not the `ClearOptions` combo variants | 🟨 real `ClearDepthStencilView` calls implemented for all 5 combo variants (`DX-25`); only plain `Clear(r,g,b,a)` has a dedicated round-trip pixel test | ⬜ not attempted — no DSV is bound in any current off-screen test (`depthEnable=false` throughout), so depth/stencil `Clear` combos have no target to exercise against yet |

### Vulkan optional device-feature gating (Task 454)

Investigated whether Vulkan's `VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures`-gated optional capabilities are requested
safely (a device that doesn't support a requested optional feature makes `vkCreateDevice` fail
outright, unlike GL/bgfx's more forgiving capability model). Confirmed the device-creation code
(`VulkanGraphicsBackend`'s constructor) only ever requests the 2 optional features CNA actually
uses — `fillModeNonSolid` (`FillMode::WireFrame`) and `samplerAnisotropy` (anisotropic texture
filtering) — and both are correctly gated behind a real `vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures` query first
(`if (supported.fillModeNonSolid) { feat.fillModeNonSolid = VK_TRUE; fillModeNonSolidSupported_ =
true; }`, same shape for `samplerAnisotropy`). Neither is ever unconditionally requested. Downstream
usage sites correctly gate on the resulting `fillModeNonSolidSupported_`/`anisotropySupported_`
flags (e.g. `fillModeWireframe_ = (fillMode == 1) && fillModeNonSolidSupported_` — a device without
`fillModeNonSolid` silently falls back to solid fill rather than requesting an invalid pipeline
state), and `maxSamplerAnisotropy_` is read from real `VkPhysicalDeviceLimits` and used to clamp any
requested anisotropy level. MSAA sample-count selection (`PickSampleCount`) also respects the
device's real `framebufferColorSampleCounts` limit, picking the best available count ≤ the
requested one rather than assuming an arbitrary count is always supported. **No gap found** — this
was already correctly implemented, just not previously documented anywhere; recorded here per Task
454's own "throw or document fallback behavior" framing (this backend's own answer is "gracefully
falls back," which is the idiomatic Vulkan pattern for optional features, not a bug needing a fix).

## OcclusionQuery (Phase 50, closed this session — see `docs/occlusionquery-support.md` for full detail)

| Feature | EasyGL | Vulkan | Bgfx | SDL_Renderer | D3D9 | D3D11 | D3D12 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Wired to real GPU work (`Begin`/`End`) | ✅ | ✅ **FIXED (Task 447, 2026-07-10)** — real per-draw-call query correlation via `Pending3DDraw::occlusionQuery` tagging + `vkCmdBeginQuery`/`vkCmdEndQuery` recording in `RecordCommandBuffer()` | ✅ (Task 448) | N/A — throws at construction (Task 727) | ⬜ **not built at all** — `plan_dx9.md`'s task list has no `IDirect3DQuery9`-based occlusion-query task; `CreateOcclusionQuery()` falls through to `IGraphicsBackend`'s own silent `nullptr` default, same gap as D3D12 | ✅ real `ID3D11Query(D3D11_QUERY_OCCLUSION)`, `Begin`/`End`/`GetData` wired (`DX-47`) | ✅ real `D3D12OcclusionQueryBackend` (`ID3D12QueryHeap`+readback buffer, `DX-120`) — a full-viewport visible triangle reports a real positive `PixelCount()`, the SAME query object reused around off-screen/clipped geometry reports exactly 0, a genuine visible-vs-invisible discrimination, off-screen (Checks AA1–AA4) |
| Pixel/query correctness (visible vs. occluded) | ✅ verified both directions (Tasks 445/446) | ✅ verified both directions, plus a multi-draw-span check (Task 854) — this sandbox's software Vulkan driver (Mesa Lavapipe) reports fully accurate, discriminating pixel counts (4096 visible / 0 occluded on a 64×64 quad) | ⚠️ can't verify in this sandbox's software GL2.1 driver; dedicated-view architecture gap open (Task 917) | N/A | N/A — no query support exists | ✅ **stale row, corrected 2026-07-15** — `plan_dx.md` `DX-147` closed this: the same `ID3D11Query` object reused around a genuinely visible (viewport-covering) draw reports a real positive `PixelCount()`, then around a fully off-screen draw reports exactly 0, both-directions discriminating (`D3D11_Smoke` 91→93/93). This row previously described the pre-`DX-147` state | ✅ **stale row, corrected 2026-07-15** — real, and closed earlier than the row above: `DX-120`'s own landing already included this exact both-directions proof (Checks `AA3`/`AA4`, `plan_dx.md` `DX-147`'s own row explicitly credits `DX-120` for closing the D3D12 half) — this row's "no query support exists" contradicted the very next table up (`OcclusionQuery` "wired to real GPU work" row, same file), which already correctly described `D3D12OcclusionQueryBackend` as real |

## Model (Phase 49, closed this session — see `docs/model-content-pipeline-support.md` for full detail)

| Feature | Status | D3D9 | D3D11 | D3D12 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Runtime API (`Model`/`ModelMesh`/`ModelMeshPart`/`ModelBone`) | ✅ fully audited/FNA-faithful, several real bugs found and fixed (Tasks 431-439) | ⬜ not separately tested against this backend | ✅ a real 2-bone hierarchy drives `Model::Draw()` → `ModelMesh::Draw()`'s genuine orchestration (bone transform, `SetVertexBuffer`/`setIndices`/`DrawIndexedPrimitives`/`EffectPass::Apply`), pixel-verified through the back buffer (`DX-128`) | ✅ same orchestration proof, off-screen through a windowless `GraphicsDevice` (`DX-148`) — found and fixed a real crash bug along the way: `SetDepthTestEnabled`/`SetDepthWriteEnabled`/`SetBlendEnabled` were still unimplemented-throw stubs, so any game driving this shared code path against D3D12 would have crashed |
| Content-pipeline loading (`ModelTypeReader`) | ⚠️ real gaps — no bone hierarchy, no `ParentBone` wiring, no `BoundingSphere`/`Tag`, custom `.model.json` format is not `.xnb`-compatible (Task 440); zero test coverage of the loader itself | ⬜ not separately tested against this backend | ⬜ not separately tested against this backend | ⬜ not separately tested against this backend |
| `Model` constructor root-bone-index flexibility | ✅ fixed (Task 916, 2026-07-09) | ⬜ not separately tested against this backend | ✅ real proof (`DX-155`) — `getRootProperty()` genuinely returns the non-zero-indexed bone, plus a full 5-argument-constructor draw through the real backend | ✅ same proof, off-screen (`DX-155`, Checks VV0/VV1) |

Note: `cna_reference_dump`/`cna_demo_2d` (both `Model`-adjacent example binaries) fail to *link*
under `D3D11` (`undefined reference to Effect::Apply()`) — found during `plan_dx.md` `DX-81`'s
coverage audit and confirmed via `git stash` to pre-date the D3D11 backend work entirely (fails
identically on the base commit); a real, pre-existing, unrelated gap, not caused or fixed by this
backend. See `docs/d3d11-backend.md`. The same link failure applies equally under `D3D12` (same
root cause, same example binaries, same shared code) — not independently re-confirmed but expected
identical, see `docs/d3d12-backend.md`.

## Every currently-BLOCKED task (⛔)

| Task | Backend | One-line reason |
|---|---|---|
| 686 | SDL_Renderer | `TextureAddressMode::Wrap` via `SpriteBatch` — no native support in the `Draw()` path used; 3 options (throw / rewrite to `SDL_RenderGeometry` / hybrid), none picked |
| 687 | SDL_Renderer | Same underlying constraint as 686, for `Mirror` — resolving 686 resolves this too |
| 725 | SDL_Renderer | `Texture3D`/`TextureCube` construction succeeds silently with a null backend; 94 existing tests rely on that silent-success behavior, so fixing needs a blast-radius-aware architecture decision |
| 732 | EasyGL | Real `SurfaceFormat` GPU forwarding conflicts with an already-shipped, already-tested `Texture::ValidateFormat` contract (Task 176) plus the public `SetData`/`GetData` API being `Color*`-only |

## Known pre-existing test-failure baseline, per backend

Confirmed most recently by this session's own regression runs (always run sequentially per
backend, never concurrently — concurrent runs have previously produced transient GPU/driver-
contention false failures):

- **EasyGL**: 3 — `EasyGL_MRT_TwoAttachments`, `EasyGL_GraphicsDevice_ReferenceStencil`,
  `easy-gl-resource-smoke-tests`. Reconfirmed as recently as Task 449's own regression (4510/4513).
- **Bgfx**: **current baseline per `NEXT.md` (verified 2026-07-11): `CnaTests` 4375/4377 (2
  hardware skips), `ctest` 103/105 — 2 remaining failures**: `Bgfx_RenderTarget2D_MsaaResolve`
  (this sandbox's Xvfb has no DRI3 support — an environment limitation, not a code bug) and
  `Bgfx_RenderTargetCube_DepthFormat` (Task 952, **DEFERRED** — a `Depth24Stencil8`-attached
  `RenderTargetCube` face produces no colour output; investigated 3 times, root cause not yet
  found). Task 951 (closed 2026-07-11) fixed 5 of the 6 pre-existing `RenderTarget2D`/
  `RenderTargetCube` `glReadPixels`/Xvfb crashes that used to be counted here (`DepthBuffer`,
  `MipChain` ×2, plus others) via a dedicated highest-id "flush" view — see `NEXT.md` §3/§5 for the
  full root-cause writeup. `Bgfx_ModelJsonReader_Quad` (Task 927/948) is also fixed and passes 2/2.
- **Vulkan**: **current baseline per `NEXT.md` (verified 2026-07-11): `CnaTests` 4371/4373 (2
  hardware skips), `ctest` 126/127 — 1 remaining failure, `Vulkan_DepthBias`.** Both the 5×
  `BlendState` failures (Task 868, fixed 2026-07-09, commit `459a0e37`) and the 3
  `ContentManagerSkinnedModelTest.*` segfaults (Task 953, fixed 2026-07-11) that used to make up
  this baseline are gone — no exclusions needed anymore. **Historical correction (2026-07-09,
  Task 861):** this row previously said "12" pre-existing failures and additionally claimed
  "several `DepthStencilState`-adjacent" ones — both wrong; `DepthStencilState`'s own
  compare-op/stencil-op tests all pass (Task 870 fixed this).
- **SDL_Renderer**: 13 known pre-existing, all throwing `"SDL_Renderer does not support 3D"` —
  matches this backend's accepted 2D-only architectural scope exactly (`EffectApplyTest`,
  `GraphicsDeviceValidationTest.SetRenderTargets_*`, `SkinnedModelEXTPartTest.*`,
  `ContentManagerSkinnedModelTest.*`). Confirmed via Task 915's own systematic full-suite run.

## Remaining genuine Vulkan limitations (Task 861, 2026-07-09)

Phase 73 (Tasks 664-665, 825-861) was written as a checklist of individual Vulkan pixel-test tasks,
but Tasks 825-860 were never checked off — later, higher-numbered work (Tasks 484/495/499/500,
plus the fog/lighting/effect fixes at 885-900) independently established most of the same ground,
superseding the original per-row checklist without formally closing each row. This section is
Task 861's real deliverable: the actual current state, confirmed by spot-checking a representative
sample of Tasks 825-860 against real test coverage rather than re-verifying all 36 rows from
scratch (that would be Task 738-scale work, out of this task's own scope).

**Genuinely already covered by real, current Vulkan tests** (confirmed via
`ctest --test-dir cmake-build-vulkan -N -R "^Vulkan_"`, 93 real tests): `TextureAddressMode`
(Clamp/Mirror), `TextureFilter` (Point vs. Linear), anisotropic filtering, all 7 `BlendState`
presets, all 6 `DepthStencilState` aspects, `CullMode`, `Viewport`, render-target lifecycle
(sample-after-unbind, MSAA, mip chains, depth-format fidelity, MRT-adjacent), and all 5 stock
effects including fog and several per-effect sub-features (specular, Fresnel, eye position, bone
blending) — this maps directly onto Tasks 825-849's own topics. **Confirmed genuine bugs found by
this later work**: `BlendState` (Task 868, **fixed 2026-07-09**), one isolated
`RasterizerState.DepthBias` sub-case (still open) — these are the real content behind Tasks 831-833
and 839's own topics, not clean passes.

**A real, previously-undocumented gap found by this spot-check**: unlike EasyGL and SDL_Renderer,
Vulkan has **no dedicated pixel test** for `SpriteBatch`'s sort-mode ordering, rotation/scale/
source-rectangle-cropping/`SpriteEffects` flip (Task 851/850's own topics), `SpriteFont` glyph
placement (Task 852), or `Model` multi-mesh hierarchy transform propagation (Task 853) —
confirmed via `grep`/`ctest -N` finding zero `Vulkan_SpriteFont*`/`Vulkan_Model*`/
`Vulkan_SpriteSortMode*` test names, despite `Vulkan_SpriteBatch_MultiBeginEnd` and
`Vulkan_Demo2D_SmokeTest` confirming basic `SpriteBatch` drawing works. Corrected the feature
matrix's own "2D SpriteBatch/SpriteFont" table above, which previously (incorrectly) rated Vulkan
✅ for this without a backing test, to "not separately re-audited" — matching the honest phrasing
already used for the adjacent SpriteFont row. This is a **test-coverage gap, not a confirmed
behavioral bug** — the underlying `SpriteBatch`/`SpriteFont`/`Model` code is backend-agnostic C++
already pixel-verified on EasyGL/SDL_Renderer, so a regression specifically on Vulkan is unlikely,
but it is genuinely unverified there. Not opened as a new numbered task here (that's Task 738-scale
triage work); flagging it in this matrix is this task's own real scope.

**`OcclusionQuery` visible-vs-occluded pixel test on Vulkan (Task 854's own topic)**: **FIXED,
2026-07-10** — was Task 447's ⛔ BLOCKED status (Vulkan's deferred-draw architecture couldn't
correlate a query's Begin/End span with a draw at all); now resolved via real per-draw-call query
tagging and `vkCmdBeginQuery`/`vkCmdEndQuery` recording, see the `OcclusionQuery` table above.

**Bottom line**: Vulkan's real, current, confirmed-open limitation is exactly 1 — the isolated
`RasterizerState.DepthBias` sub-case. `BlendState` (Task 868) is fixed as of 2026-07-09, and
`ReferenceStencil` is fixed on Vulkan specifically (an undocumented side effect of Task 870); the
`ReferenceStencil` gap (Task 872) remains open only on EasyGL and Bgfx. The 2D
SpriteBatch/SpriteFont/Model-hierarchy test-coverage gap above is real but distinct in kind
(untested, not un-implemented or known-broken). `OcclusionQuery` (Task 447/854) is no longer on this
list — fixed in full.

## Remaining genuine Bgfx limitations (Task 824, 2026-07-10)

Phase 72 (Bgfx full 2D+3D pixel-verified parity, Tasks 740-824) is now closed in full: of the
original 38 confirmed real gaps found in a first-ever complete row-by-row triage, 37 are ✅ closed
this session and exactly 1 remains open, explicitly flagged (not silently skipped). Three genuine,
confirmed limitations survive this closure — none of them a code bug in this project, each already
root-caused rather than merely observed:

- **Constant `DepthBias` (Task 767): FIXED, 2026-07-10.** Project-owner decision received: bgfx's
  high-level state API has zero depth-bias/polygon-offset mechanism anywhere (confirmed via
  `bgfx/defines.h` — no `BIAS`/`OFFSET` flag exists — and the vendored `renderer_gl.cpp` — no
  `glPolygonOffset` call in the whole file), so constant `DepthBias` is now emulated via a per-draw
  vertex-shader Z-offset (`BgfxGraphicsBackend::SetDepthBiasUniform`, a new `u_depthBias` uniform
  added to every 3D vertex shader, scaled by `kDepthBiasScale` to roughly match the visual magnitude
  a real GL/Vulkan polygon-offset implementation would produce). New `Bgfx_RasterizerState_DepthBias`
  test confirms both the zero-bias baseline (stays RED) and a large negative bias (pulls a coplanar
  redraw in front, turns GREEN); verified via `git stash` revert-and-rebuild.
  **`SlopeScaleDepthBias` remains an intentionally undone gap** (project-owner decision, not
  attempted): a true per-fragment screen-space-slope computation would force every 3D shader off the
  early-Z path, even at `DepthBias=0`, unless duplicate shader variants were added — not worth the
  cost for this one property. EasyGL, by contrast, needed no shader emulation at all: it already had
  real `glPolygonOffset` support in the vendored `easy-gl` library, just never wired up — fixed with
  a native call, covering both constant and slope-scale bias in one shot (see Task 767's own
  `plan_graphics.md` entry). Only Vulkan implements real hardware depth bias (`vkCmdSetDepthBias`,
  dynamic state, including real slope-scale).
- ~~**`RenderTarget2D`/`RenderTargetCube` `glReadPixels` crashes under this sandbox's software GL
  driver**~~ (`Bgfx_RenderTarget2D_DepthBuffer`/`MsaaResolve`/`MipChain`,
  `Bgfx_RenderTargetCube_MipChain`/`MsaaResolve`/`DepthFormat` — 6 tests, all pre-existing at the
  time this section was written) — **5 of these 6 fixed by Task 951 (closed 2026-07-11)**, root
  cause: bgfx processes views in ascending id order each frame, so any render-target view was
  always last-processed and still GL-bound when `glReadPixels()` fired; fixed via a dedicated,
  always-last-processed "flush" view touched right before every screenshot request. Only
  `Bgfx_RenderTargetCube_DepthFormat` remains open (Task 952, **DEFERRED** — a genuinely different,
  still-unsolved root cause: a `Depth24Stencil8`-attached `RenderTargetCube` face produces no colour
  output at all, not a crash). `Bgfx_RenderTarget2D_MsaaResolve` also remains, but as a real
  environment ceiling (no DRI3 in this sandbox), not part of Task 951's crash class. See `NEXT.md`
  §5 for the current, authoritative 2-failure baseline.
- **`OcclusionQuery.PixelCount()` doesn't discriminate visible from occluded geometry in this
  sandbox** (Tasks 814/815): a dedicated scratch probe confirmed the exact same numeric value is
  returned regardless of scene content, extending Task 448's own already-documented finding
  (`IsComplete()`/`PixelCount()` can't distinguish a wired-up query from a never-submitted one) to
  the actual pixel-count magnitude too — the underlying rendering/depth-occlusion behavior each
  scenario depends on IS reliably pixel-verified instead (`Bgfx_OcclusionQuery_PixelCount`'s own 2
  real, sabotage-verified checks). Same software-renderer ceiling as above, not a CNA defect.

**FIXED, 2026-07-10 (Task 927/948): `BgfxGraphicsBackend` never overrode `DrawIndexedPrimitivesEx`**
— was a **real CNA gap**, not an environment limitation, first flagged as an "adjacent, out-of-scope
discovery" by Task 766 and concretely reproduced by `Bgfx_ModelJsonReader_Quad` (previously a
documented 1/2 known failure). Any indexed, `Effect`-bound draw with a vertex format lacking a
`Color` attribute (`VertexPositionNormalTexture`/`VertexPositionTexture` — i.e. any
`Content.Load<Model>()`-loaded mesh) silently fell back to the base `IGraphicsBackend`'s default
`DrawIndexedPrimitivesEx`, which discarded `GpuDrawParams` entirely and rendered via the `colored3D`
pipeline instead — reading an unbound `a_color0` attribute (GL default `(0,0,0,1)`), so the mesh
rendered solid black regardless of its real `DiffuseColor`/texture/lighting. Fixed by adding a real
`BgfxGraphicsBackend::DrawIndexedPrimitivesEx` override mirroring `DrawPrimitivesEx`'s own full
`GpuDrawParams` dispatch; `Bgfx_ModelJsonReader_Quad` now passes 2/2.

**Bottom line**: Bgfx's only remaining code-level gap is Task 767 (depth bias), already flagged for
a project-owner decision; the other 2 items are sandbox/environment ceilings, already root-caused,
that would need a real GPU-backed test environment to resolve or re-confirm — not further Bgfx
backend code work.

## New tracked follow-up tasks opened this session

- ~~**Task 916**~~ — **fixed, 2026-07-09** (same day it was opened): `Model`'s constructor used to
  auto-default `Root` to `bones[0]` with no way to specify a different root bone index; an optional
  `rootBoneIndex` parameter now covers it (low-risk, purely-additive fix).
- **Task 917** — Bgfx occlusion queries share a view/depth buffer with other same-frame geometry
  instead of using bgfx's own dedicated-measurement-view pattern; needed for true scene-depth
  query correctness (deferred, not blocked, can't be verified in this sandbox anyway).

## Remaining genuine D3D9 limitations (`D9-130`, 2026-07-15)

Unlike the other 6 columns, `D3D9`'s ✅ cells above are not "implemented and plausible" — they are
each backed by a byte-identical (`--tolerance 0`) match against the real XNA 4.0 runtime for a
checked-in oracle scene (`D9-120`, `D3D9_XNA_Diff`). The corpus has grown to 36/36 scenes (0
diverge) as of Task 1101 (2026-07-16), up from 31 at `D9-130`'s original 2026-07-15 writing.
**Three of this section's original six gaps are now fixed, corrected below rather than silently
removed** — the genuine, currently-open gaps are:

- **`Texture3D` has no GPU round-trip or oracle coverage at all** — only its `GraphicsProfile`
  size-ceiling is tested; no scene in the corpus samples a `Texture3D` in a shader.
- **`OcclusionQuery` is not built** for this backend (same gap as D3D12).
- **Not verified on real Windows hardware** (`D9-140`) — every result here is Wine+DXVK-on-this-
  machine, same caveat as `D3D11`/`D3D12`.

Fixed since this section was originally written (2026-07-15):

- ~~Render targets cannot be sampled as textures at all — a reproducible, uncaught DXVK crash~~ —
  **fixed 2026-07-16**: a real type-confusion bug (`static_cast` between the unrelated sibling
  classes `D3D9TextureBackend`/`D3D9RenderTargetBackend`, both implementing `ITextureBackend`),
  not a DXVK/environment limitation. See `NEXT.md` §4 and `src/CNA/Internal/Backends/D3D9/
  D3D9EffectDraw.cpp`'s `ResolveD3D9TextureEXT`/`ResolveD3D9TextureCubeEXT`.
- ~~`PreferPerPixelLighting` and real specular highlights are structurally unreachable~~ — **fixed
  2026-07-16** (`plan_graphics.md` Phase 80, Task 1101): `GpuDrawParams::preferPerPixelLighting`/
  `specularEnabled` are now real fields (Task 1100), read by this backend's dispatch instead of
  hardcoded `false`. 4 of the 5 `PixelLighting` bytecode variants `D9-73` had flagged as diverging
  from Microsoft's own shipped bytes are now oracle-proven pixel-perfect; the 5th (untextured
  `VSBasicPixelLighting`) remains permanently unreachable, blocked by the same missing Position-only
  vertex layout as the untextured vertex-lit bucket — unrelated to this fix. This was also the
  project-wide "Divergence 1" every other CNA backend shared; `plan_graphics.md` Phase 80 has since
  fixed EasyGL/Vulkan/Bgfx/WebGPU(`BasicEffect`-only)/D3D11/D3D12 too — only the `Software` backend
  remains, deferred (no lighting engine of any kind exists there yet, a larger and differently-shaped
  gap, see Phase 80's own Task 1108 row).
- ~~`CnaTests` does not build under D3D9~~ — **fixed** (`D9-123`, 2026-07-15, same session `D9-130`
  was written in but not yet reflected here): all POSIX `::setenv()`/`::unsetenv()` call sites
  replaced with `System::Environment::SetEnvironmentVariable`; `CnaTests` compiles and the
  `gtest_discover_tests`/`CROSSCOMPILING_EMULATOR` wiring works under D3D9.

See `docs/d3d9-backend.md` for the full writeup and `docs/d3d9-divergence-report.md` for the raw
