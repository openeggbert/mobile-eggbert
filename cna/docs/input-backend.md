## 1. Overview

Real input behavior flows through one internal bridge and one internal state accumulator:

```
SDL_PollEvent  (Game::PollEvents(), called once per frame from Game::Tick())
  → CNA::Internal::Input::SdlInputBridge::ProcessEvent(event)   // switch on event.type
      → CNA::Internal::Input::InputManager::Set*State(...)      // keyboard / mouse / gamepad / touch snapshot
      → Microsoft::Xna::Framework::Input::TextInputEXT::INTERNAL_On*(...)   // text input / editing
      → Microsoft::Xna::Framework::Input::Touch::TouchPanel::INTERNAL_onTouchEvent(...)
          → CNA::Internal::Input::GestureDetector::On{Pressed,Moved,Released}(...)
  → Keyboard/Mouse/GamePad/TouchPanel::GetState()   // read by game code each frame
  → Microsoft::Xna::Framework::FrameworkDispatcher::Update()
      → TouchPanel::Update() → GestureDetector::OnUpdate()   // Hold/Flick timing gestures
```

Two classes do the work:

- **`CNA::Internal::Input::SdlInputBridge`** (`include/CNA/Internal/Input/SdlInputBridge.hpp`,
  `src/CNA/Internal/Input/SdlInputBridge.cpp`) — the single SDL event funnel. `ProcessEvent`
  is the *only* place that reads an `SDL_Event`; do not add a second event path. It also
  exposes public static query methods that XNA-layer classes call into directly (not through
  the event stream): `SetVibration`, `SetTriggerVibration`, `SetLightBar`, `GetGUID`, `GetGyro`,
  `GetAccelerometer`, `GetCapabilities`, `GetKeyFromScancode`. This dual role — event funnel
  plus query surface — is intentional; adding a query method here is fine, adding a second
  event-processing entry point is not.
- **`CNA::Internal::Input::InputManager`** (`include/CNA/Internal/Input/InputManager.hpp`,
  `src/CNA/Internal/Input/InputManager.cpp`) — accumulates per-device state pushed by
  `SdlInputBridge` (`Set*State`/`Add*Delta` methods) and hands back immutable XNA state-object
  snapshots (`Get*State` methods: `GetMouseState`, `GetKeyboardState`, `GetTouchState`,
  `GetGamePadState`, `GetRawGamePadState`). `GamePad::GetState(playerIndex, deadZoneMode)` calls
  `GetRawGamePadState` and applies dead-zone processing itself at the XNA layer, since the same
  raw state can be read back through three different `GamePadDeadZone` modes.

Touch additionally has a third internal class:

- **`CNA::Internal::Input::GestureDetector`** (`include/CNA/Internal/Input/GestureDetector.hpp`,
  `src/CNA/Internal/Input/GestureDetector.cpp`) — a ported gesture-recognition state machine
  (Tap, DoubleTap, Hold, HorizontalDrag, VerticalDrag, FreeDrag, Flick, DragComplete, Pinch,
  PinchComplete). Driven by `TouchPanel::INTERNAL_onTouchEvent` (per-event) and
  `TouchPanel::Update()` (per-frame, for timing-based gestures like Hold and the DoubleTap
  window). Recognized gestures are enqueued via `TouchPanel::EnqueueGesture` and drained by
  game code through `TouchPanel::ReadGesture()`.

---

## 2. SDL3 event → XNA state mapping

Every case in `SdlInputBridge::ProcessEvent`'s `switch (event.type)`. This is the complete list;
if an `SDL_Event` type isn't in this table, CNA does not currently handle it (falls through to
the `default: break;` case).

| SDL event | InputManager / TouchPanel call | XNA-visible effect |
|---|---|---|
| `SDL_EVENT_MOUSE_MOTION` | `SetMousePosition` (window→logical coords via `to_logical_position`), `AddMouseRelativeDelta(xrel, yrel)` | `Mouse::GetState().X/Y`; relative-mode delta accumulator (drained on next `GetState()` read while `IsRelativeMouseModeEXT` is on) |
| `SDL_EVENT_MOUSE_BUTTON_DOWN` / `_UP` | `SetMouseButtonState` (Left/Right/Middle/XButton1/XButton2), `SetMousePosition`; on DOWN also `Mouse::INTERNAL_onClicked(button-1)` | `Mouse::GetState().LeftButton` etc.; `Mouse::ClickedEXT` fires |
| `SDL_EVENT_MOUSE_WHEEL` | `AddScrollWheelDelta(wheel.y * 120)` | `Mouse::GetState().ScrollWheelValue` (cumulative, XNA units of 120 per notch) |
| `SDL_EVENT_MOUSE_ADDED` / `_REMOVED` | none (bypasses `InputManager`) | `CNA::Input::InputDevices::MouseConnectedEXT`/`MouseDisconnectedEXT.Invoke(event.mdevice.which)` — NOXNA hotplug notification only |
| `SDL_EVENT_KEYBOARD_ADDED` / `_REMOVED` | none (bypasses `InputManager`) | `CNA::Input::InputDevices::KeyboardConnectedEXT`/`KeyboardDisconnectedEXT.Invoke(event.kdevice.which)` — NOXNA hotplug notification only |
| `SDL_EVENT_KEY_DOWN` / `_UP` | `SetKeyState(key, pressed)` (skipped on key-repeat — state is already set); also drives control-character `TextInput` synthesis (`handle_text_input_key_down/up`) | `Keyboard::GetState().IsKeyDown/Up`; `Keys` resolved via `try_convert_sdl_scancode` (scancode mode) or `try_convert_sdl_key` (default mode) — see §4 |
| `SDL_EVENT_TEXT_INPUT` | none (bypasses `InputManager`) | `event.text.text` (UTF-8) is decoded to UTF-16 code units (`decode_utf8_to_utf16`) and each is dispatched via `TextInputEXT::INTERNAL_OnTextInput(charcs)` — one UTF-16 code unit per call, astral code points as surrogate pairs, matching FNA's `Encoding.UTF8.GetChars`; suppressed while a synthesized Ctrl+V paste is in flight |
| `SDL_EVENT_TEXT_EDITING` | none | `TextInputEXT::INTERNAL_OnTextEditing(text, start, length)` — empty/null composition maps to `("", 0, 0)` |
| `SDL_EVENT_TEXT_EDITING_CANDIDATES` | none | `TextInputEXT::INTERNAL_OnTextEditingCandidates(candidates, selected, horizontal)` — NOXNA IME candidate-list extension; null candidates dispatch as an empty list |
| `SDL_EVENT_FINGER_DOWN` | `SetTouchState(id, Pressed, pixelPos)`; also `TouchPanel::setTouchDeviceExistsProperty(true)` and `TouchPanel::INTERNAL_onTouchEvent(id, Pressed, x, y, 0, 0)` | `TouchPanel::GetState()`; `GestureDetector::OnPressed` |
| `SDL_EVENT_FINGER_MOTION` | `SetTouchState(id, Moved, pixelPos)`; `TouchPanel::INTERNAL_onTouchEvent(id, Moved, x, y, dx, dy)` | `TouchPanel::GetState()`; `GestureDetector::OnMoved` |
| `SDL_EVENT_FINGER_UP` / `SDL_EVENT_FINGER_CANCELED` | `SetTouchState(id, Released, pixelPos)`; `TouchPanel::INTERNAL_onTouchEvent(id, Released, x, y, 0, 0)` | `TouchPanel::GetState()`; `GestureDetector::OnReleased` — both event types share one `case` fallthrough (P5-034/P6 audit), matching FNA's own `SDL_EVENT_FINGER_UP \|\| SDL_EVENT_FINGER_CANCELED` single branch |
| `SDL_EVENT_GAMEPAD_ADDED` | `SetGamePadConnection(playerIndex, true)` (assigns the next free `PlayerIndex` slot, opens the `SDL_Gamepad`) | `GamePad::GetState(playerIndex).IsConnected` |
| `SDL_EVENT_GAMEPAD_REMOVED` | `SetGamePadConnection(playerIndex, false)` (closes the `SDL_Gamepad`, frees the slot) | `GamePad::GetState(playerIndex).IsConnected` becomes false |
| `SDL_EVENT_GAMEPAD_BUTTON_DOWN` / `_UP` | `SetGamePadButtonState(playerIndex, button, state)` | `GamePadState.Buttons`/`.DPad` |
| `SDL_EVENT_GAMEPAD_AXIS_MOTION` | `SetGamePadAxisValue(playerIndex, axis, normalizedValue)` (stick Y axes negated to match XNA's up-positive convention) | `GamePadState.ThumbSticks`/`.Triggers` (raw; dead zone applied by `GamePad::GetState`) |
| `SDL_EVENT_JOYSTICK_ADDED` / `_REMOVED` | none (bypasses `InputManager` — separate `get_opened_joysticks()` handle map) | `CNA::Input::Joysticks::ConnectedEXT`/`DisconnectedEXT.Invoke(deviceId)` — the raw-joystick NOXNA extension, distinct from `GamePad`'s XNA-mapped view of the same physical device (P7-017/029/P8-013) |

**Intentionally unhandled event types (P8-012/014, confirmed 2026-07-17):**
- `SDL_EVENT_GAMEPAD_REMAPPED` — FNA itself has no handler for this event either (confirmed: zero
  matches in `SDL3_FNAPlatform.cs`). XNA's `Buttons`/`GamePadState` model is read fresh on every
  `GetState()` call rather than cached, so a live SDL mapping change is simply picked up on the next
  read with no special-case handling needed in either engine.
- `SDL_EVENT_SENSOR_UPDATE` — `CNA::Input::Sensors` (and `Microsoft::Devices::Sensors::Accelerometer`
  etc.) read sensor data via an on-demand `SDL_GetSensorData` poll (`SystemSensorBackend.cpp:80`), the
  same "query, not event-stream" pattern already used for gamepad rumble/light bar/gyro/accelerometer
  (§2 above). There is no sensor *event* to route.

Touch coordinates: SDL delivers finger position/delta normalized to `[0, 1]` relative to the
window. There are two independent scaling paths from that same normalized event, feeding two
different consumers: `to_touch_pixel_position` (file-local to `SdlInputBridge.cpp`) scales by
the SDL window's point size (`SDL_GetWindowSize`) then maps through the graphics backend's
logical-coordinate transform, feeding `InputManager::SetTouchState` (and so
`TouchPanel::GetState()`'s fallback snapshot, §3); `TouchPanel::INTERNAL_onTouchEvent` instead
scales by `TouchPanel::DisplayWidth`/`DisplayHeight` (set from the real back-buffer size by
`GraphicsDevice`, task 711), feeding `GestureDetector`. Both match FNA's own
normalized→pixel intent, just via two different size sources for two different consumers.

Gamepad rumble, light bar, trigger vibration, gyroscope, and accelerometer are **not** part of
the event stream above — they're on-demand queries/commands issued by `GamePad`'s EXT methods
directly through `SdlInputBridge`'s public static methods (`SetVibration`, `SetLightBar`,
`SetTriggerVibration`, `GetGyro`, `GetAccelerometer`), not accumulated state.

---

## 3. Event-driven vs. FNA's poll-driven model

This is the single biggest architectural deviation from FNA, and it applies uniformly across
every input device:

- **FNA** re-queries the platform layer fresh on every `Get*State()` call. `Keyboard.GetState()`,
  `Mouse.GetState()`, `GamePad.GetState()`, and `TouchPanel.GetState()` all call into
  `SDL3_FNAPlatform` methods that ask SDL for current state *at call time*.
- **CNA** is event-driven. `SdlInputBridge::ProcessEvent` accumulates whatever SDL delivers into
  `InputManager`'s (or `TouchPanel`'s) internal fields as events arrive; `Get*State()` methods
  just read back that accumulated state — they never touch SDL themselves.

What keeps CNA's accumulated state current: `Game::Tick()` (`Game.cpp`) unconditionally calls
`PollEvents()` → `SDL_PollEvent` → `SdlInputBridge::ProcessEvent` exactly once per frame, before
`Update()`/`Draw()` run, on every code path that reaches a frame (`Run()`→`RunLoop()`→`Tick()`,
`RunOneFrame()`→`Tick()`, and the Emscripten main-loop callback all funnel through this). As long
as that per-frame pump keeps happening, the practical behavior is indistinguishable from FNA's
poll-per-call model for game code that reads input once per `Update()`.

Where the difference is actually visible:

- Calling `Get*State()` **more than once per frame** returns the *same* snapshot both times in
  CNA (nothing changed since the last `Tick()`), whereas FNA could theoretically observe SDL
  state changing mid-frame between two calls (in practice this rarely matters, since SDL itself
  only updates on `SDL_PollEvent`).
- `TouchPanel::GetState()` specifically has its own extra wrinkle: FNA populates its `touches_`
  array from a per-frame poll (`SDL_GetTouchFingers`) via `SetFinger`, but CNA's `SetFinger` has
  no real caller — `GetState()` instead falls back to `InputManager::GetTouchState()`'s
  event-accumulated snapshot. Documented in-source in `TouchPanel.cpp` (task 714).
- `GamePadState.PacketNumber` can't be "bump on state comparison" like FNA's poll loop, since
  CNA never builds two consecutive `GamePadState`s to diff — instead it's bumped at the raw
  `InputManager` layer whenever a connection/button/axis value actually changes (task 729,
  documented in-source in `InputManager.cpp`).
- Mouse relative-mode delta (`IsRelativeMouseModeEXT`) is accumulated from
  `SDL_EVENT_MOUSE_MOTION`'s `xrel`/`yrel` and drained to zero on each `GetMouseState()` read,
  rather than FNA's `SDL_GetRelativeMouseState()` poll — the event-driven equivalent of the same
  API (documented in-source in `InputManager.cpp`).

---

## 4. Per-device fidelity notes

Full per-task detail lives in `plan_input.md` (Phases I1–I6) and `AUDIT.md`'s `Input`/
`Input::Touch` tables (`Runtime` column). Summary of what's real vs. what deviates:

### Keyboard

- `Keyboard::GetState()` is a straight read of `InputManager`'s accumulated key-state set.
- `Keyboard::GetKeyFromScancodeEXT` has two modes, matching FNA's `UseScancodes` switch: default
  mode round-trips a US-layout `Keys` value through `SDL_GetKeyFromScancode` and back to
  translate for the *current* keyboard layout; scancode mode (`FNA_KEYBOARD_USE_SCANCODES=1`,
  read once into a process-wide cached flag on first use) does a direct physical-position
  lookup via a ported `INTERNAL_scanMap` table and passes `GetKeyFromScancodeEXT`'s input straight
  through unchanged (tasks 764–765).
- `KeyboardState::GetPressedKeys()` returns keys sorted ascending by numeric `Keys` value (task
  760); `GetHashCode()` reconstructs FNA's 8×32-bit word layout and XORs them (task 761);
  `ToString()` matches FNA's `ValueType` default, `"Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Input.KeyboardState"`
  (task 766, not the placeholder it used to be).
- Storage remains an `std::unordered_set<Keys>` rather than FNA's native bitfield representation
  — an accepted internal-representation deviation; the ordering/hash *contract* matches FNA, the
  storage layout doesn't need to.
- The three SDL↔XNA mapping tables (`try_convert_sdl_key`, `try_convert_sdl_scancode`,
  `try_convert_keys_to_sdl_scancode`) were audited against FNA's `keyMap`/`scanMap`/`xnaMap` (task
  819) and are faithful 1:1 ports — zero missing entries, zero mismatches. The only CNA-specific
  addition is `SDLK_AC_BACK → Keys::Escape` (Android back button; no FNA equivalent). **40 XNA
  `Keys` values have no SDL scancode and intentionally cannot round-trip** through
  `GetKeyFromScancodeEXT` — the IME keys (Kana, Kanji, ImeConvert, …), browser/media keys,
  ChatPad keys, and a few OEM/system keys (Attn, Crsel, Pa1, …); the full list is documented in a
  source comment on `try_convert_keys_to_sdl_scancode`. This matches FNA's own `xnaMap` omissions.

### Mouse

- `Mouse::SetPosition`, `IsRelativeMouseModeEXT`, and `ClickedEXT` are all wired to real SDL3
  calls (`SDL_WarpMouseInWindow`, `SDL_Get/SetWindowRelativeMouseMode`) rather than stubs
  (Phase I4, tasks 745–749).
- `SetPosition` converts the caller's logical coordinates to window space before the warp
  (INPUT-MOUSE-002 (decision a-0001)), so the OS cursor lands at the correct pixel on a scaled window: the
  SDL_Renderer path uses `SDL_RenderCoordinatesToWindow` (**offset-aware**, so true-letterbox bars
  map correctly — verified for a 200×100 window in task 858), and EasyGL uses its
  `TransformLogicalToWindow` (a uniform height-scale with no offset, which is exact for EasyGL's
  `FixedHeightDynamicWidth` model — the logical width tracks the window aspect, so there are no
  bars to offset). Vulkan/bgfx pass through (no logical-presentation scaling).
- `MouseCursor` (custom + 11 stock system cursors) is a MonoGame-derived `NOXNA` extension — FNA
  has no `MouseCursor` type at all. Kept as a deliberate, documented status decision (task 754),
  since `Mouse::SetCursor(MouseCursor&)` depends on it and it's the standard way
  MonoGame/FNA-family games set cursors.

### GamePad

- `GetState`/`GetCapabilities`/`SetVibration` and every EXT method (light bar, trigger
  vibration, gyroscope, accelerometer reads) are wired to real `SDL_Gamepad` hardware, not
  stubs (Phase I3, tasks 725–740).
- `PacketNumber` semantics are an accepted deviation from FNA's poll-and-compare algorithm — see
  §3 above.
- `GamePadState::GetHashCode()` (`buttons_.GetHashCode() ^ (packetNumber_ * 31)`) is **not** a
  literal FNA port: FNA's own `GetHashCode()` is `return base.GetHashCode()`, .NET's
  non-deterministic reflection-based default, which has no reproducible C++ equivalent. CNA's
  formula is a reasonable accepted substitute, documented as such in `AUDIT.md`.
- `FNA_GAMEPAD_NUM_GAMEPADS` env override is ported (task 734), but clamped to 4 slots since
  `PlayerIndex` is frozen XNA API (only One–Four) — going *above* 4 has no addressable slot.

### Touch

- `SDL_EVENT_FINGER_*` feed `TouchPanel::INTERNAL_onTouchEvent`, which drives
  `GestureDetector`'s state machine directly — this is what makes Tap, DoubleTap, Hold,
  Horizontal/Vertical/Free drag, Flick, Pinch, and PinchComplete recognition work end-to-end
  (Phase I2, the INPUT-TOUCH-* / INPUT-GESTURE-* cluster; previously the pipeline was entirely dead —
  no caller ever reached `GestureDetector`).
- `TouchDeviceExists` only becomes true after the *first* touch event, matching FNA's own
  comment ("Windows only notices a touch screen once it's touched").
- `TouchPanel::GetState()` reports `TouchLocation`s with their previous location preserved for
  Moved/Released touches, so `TryGetPreviousLocation()` works on the real event-driven path —
  `InputManager` now stores each touch's previous state/position and advances it per snapshot
  (INPUT-TOUCH-007; the Phase I12 event-driven previous-location fix). A new Pressed touch has no
  previous, matching FNA.
- Known deviation (behaviourally equivalent, not a gap): `GetState()` reads `InputManager`'s
  event-driven snapshot rather than FNA's per-frame `SetFinger`/`SDL_GetTouchFingers` poll of
  `touches_` — see §3. The event-driven `InputManager` map is internally unbounded, but
  `GetState()` caps the public snapshot at `MAX_TOUCHES` (8) to match FNA (DEC-10, 2026-07-05).
- `TouchPanel::GetCapabilities()` reports `MaximumTouchCount = 0` when disconnected and **4** when
  connected, matching FNA's `touchDeviceExists ? 4 : 0` (DEC-09, 2026-07-05 — XNA always reports 4;
  the value is a fixed XNA-compat constant, not the `MAX_TOUCHES` tracking cap).

### TextInputEXT

- Wired to `SDL_StartTextInput`/`StopTextInput`, `SDL_SetTextInputArea`,
  `SDL_EVENT_TEXT_INPUT`/`_EDITING` (Phase I1, tasks 700–708), including control-character
  synthesis for keys SDL doesn't deliver as `TEXT_INPUT` (Home/End/Back/Tab/Enter/Delete,
  Ctrl+V) and Ctrl+V paste-echo suppression.
- The `TextInput`/`INTERNAL_OnTextInput` callback is `charcs` (`char16_t`) — one UTF-16 code unit
  per call, with astral code points delivered as a high/low surrogate pair, matching FNA's
  `Action<char>` exactly (task 806). The bridge decodes SDL's UTF-8 to UTF-16 via
  `decode_utf8_to_utf16`. `TextEditing` remains a UTF-8 `std::string` (FNA's `Action<string,int,int>`
  maps to `std::string`) — a separate, still-intact deviation.

---

## 5. Running the input tests

All input coverage lives in the single `CnaTests` binary. To build and run just the input
suites (Keyboard, Mouse, MouseCursor, GamePad, Touch, Gesture, TextInputEXT, and the internal
`SdlInputBridge` bridge tests) on the default EasyGL backend:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive   # first time only (see README)
cmake -S . -B cmake-build-input-easygl -G Ninja -DCNA_GRAPHICS_BACKEND=EASYGL -DCNA_BUILD_TESTS=ON
cmake --build cmake-build-input-easygl --target CnaTests -j"$(nproc)"

# Canonical input-test selector (INPUT-BUILD-003): runs the single-source-of-truth filter
# (CNA_INPUT_TEST_FILTER in CMakeLists.txt), shuffled x3 for order-independence.
ctest --test-dir cmake-build-input-easygl -L input --output-on-failure
```

`ctest -L input` is the one authoritative way to run the input subset; the token list lives only in
`CMakeLists.txt` (`CNA_INPUT_TEST_FILTER`) and the **authoritative counts** live in
`docs/input-build-and-test.md` (§Test counts). Order-dependence in the process-wide static input state
(`InputManager`, `GestureDetector`, and the `MouseCursor` stock-cursor singletons all persist for the
process lifetime) is shaken out by the baked-in `--gtest_shuffle --gtest_repeat=5` — the standardized
determinism gate (INPUT-BUILD-009); bump the repeat higher via a direct binary invocation with the same
filter variable if you want more iterations.

Swap `-DCNA_GRAPHICS_BACKEND=EASYGL` for `VULKAN` or `BGFX` to verify the same input tests on the
other backends (bgfx adds 4 backend-specific, input-unrelated tests). The full suite is just
`./cmake-build-input-easygl/CnaTests` with no filter.

---

## 6. Thread safety

**Input is a single-threaded (game-loop-thread) API.** All input state described above —
`InputManager`'s accumulated `InternalInputState`, `GestureDetector`'s state machine,
`TouchPanel`'s touch arrays and gesture queue, and the static `Mouse::ClickedEXT` /
`TextInputEXT` callbacks — is plain process-wide static state with **no locking** (verified:
there is no `mutex`/`atomic`/`thread` anywhere under `src/CNA/Internal/Input/` or
`src/Microsoft/Xna/Framework/Input/`). That is deliberate and safe because every access happens on
one thread:

- **Writes** flow from `Game::PollEvents()` → `SdlInputBridge::ProcessEvent` → `InputManager::Set*`
  / `TouchPanel::INTERNAL_onTouchEvent`. `PollEvents()` is called from `Game::Tick()`, on the
  thread that runs the game loop.
- **Reads** flow from game code calling `Keyboard/Mouse/GamePad/TouchPanel::GetState()` in
  `Update()`/`Draw()`, which the same loop invokes on that same thread.

This matches XNA/FNA (where `Game.Update`/`Draw` run on the main thread) and is also required by
SDL itself: `SDL_PollEvent` must be pumped on the thread that initialized video / created the
window. The function-local-static singletons (`InputManager`'s state, the `MouseCursor` stock
cursors, `GestureDetector`'s state) rely on C++11's thread-safe static *initialization*, but their
subsequent mutation is unsynchronized — which is fine under the single-thread contract.

**Consequence for game code:** do not call `Get*State()` (or the `Set*`/`INTERNAL_*` entry points)
from a background thread while the game loop is pumping events — that is outside the XNA input
contract and would be an unsynchronized data race. No locking is added because the single-thread
model makes it unnecessary; adding it would only cost per-frame overhead.

**Event-pump freshness (INPUT-KBD-022).** Because writes are event-driven, every `Get*State()`
snapshot — keyboard, mouse, gamepad, touch — is only as fresh as the **last `Game::PollEvents()`**
(pumped once per `Game::Tick()`, before `Update()`/`Draw()`). CNA does **not** re-query SDL inside
`Get*State()` (FNA does poll fresh; see §3), so a key pressed between two frames is not observed
until the next tick pumps its `SDL_EVENT_KEY_DOWN`. Within a single `Update()` the state is stable.
This is the authoritative statement of both properties (single-thread + per-tick freshness); the
`InputManager` class doc and [`docs/platform-input-notes.md`](platform-input-notes.md) (§Cross-cutting)
point here.
