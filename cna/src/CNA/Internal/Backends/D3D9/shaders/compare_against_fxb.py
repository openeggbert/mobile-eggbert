"""plan_dx9.md D9-73: compare our compiled D3D9 shader bytecode against the bytecode
Microsoft actually shipped inside FNA's original XNA Stock Effects .fxb files.

Why the comparison strips comment tokens: D3D9 shader bytecode carries the constant
table (CTAB) and the compiler's own creator string in comment blocks. Those legitimately
differ between compiler versions and source paths, so a raw byte compare always reports
0 matches even when the instruction streams are identical. Stripping comment tokens and
comparing what is left compares the actual shader.

Result on 2026-07-14: 61 of our 66 shaders matched Microsoft's shipped instruction stream
exactly. The 5 that did not are all PixelLighting vertex variants, and the cause is a
compiler-version difference (d3dcompiler_47 vs the XNA-era D3DCompiler_43), NOT a compile
flag -- OPTIMIZATION_LEVEL0/1/2/3, SKIP_OPTIMIZATION and AVOID_FLOW_CONTROL were all tried
and none matched.
